## Smoke test for the from-source ``kdedSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the FIFTY-EIGHTH real
## production from-source recipe and the CLOSING (FOURTH) recipe in
## the THIRD KF6 module-sweep batch (ksvg / ksolid / kio / kded).
## kded's coverage angle is the FIRST KF6-batch recipe to ship a
## LIBRARY + EXECUTABLE pair from a single ``package`` macro — the
## sddm precedent (3 artifacts) and gdm precedent (2 executables)
## cover the multi-artifact-per-package M9.K registry path; kded
## covers the (lib, exe) doublet specifically.
##
## Coverage (11 check assertions across 8 tests):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``cmakeFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + configure channels MUST be empty).
##   * TWO artifacts registration (M3) — ``libKF6Ded`` tagged
##     ``dakLibrary`` and ``kded6`` tagged ``dakExecutable``. The
##     ``kded6`` digit-suffixed name pins the gdm + sddm precedent
##     of retaining ABI-line digits in artifact identifiers.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
