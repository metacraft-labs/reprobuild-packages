## Smoke test for the from-source ``gdmSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the SEVENTEENTH real production
## from-source recipe and the SECOND recipe in the GNOME stack batch.
## gdm's unique coverage angle vs expat (the first autotools recipe)
## is twofold: (a) it's the first autotools recipe to ship TWO
## executable artifacts from one ``package`` macro, and (b) its
## ``configureFlags:`` set exercises every autotools-flag idiom in one
## sequence (``--disable-*``, ``--without-*``, ``--with-*=value``,
## ``--disable-*=false`` polarity flip, ``--enable-*``). The
## cross-channel isolation pin below would surface a regression that
## leaks ``./configure`` flags into the meson, cmake, or make channels
## (or vice versa).
##
## Coverage (12 check assertions across 8 tests):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + cmake channels MUST be empty).
##   * TWO executable artifact registration (M3) — ``gdm`` +
##     ``gdmGreeterSession`` both tagged ``dakExecutable`` under the
##     same package.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
