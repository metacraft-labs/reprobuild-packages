## Source-from-tarball cairo recipe — the TENTH real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio
## (fetch: + mesonOptions: + convention-layer fetch-action emission).
##
## Follows the dbus-broker (executables only), libdrm (libraries only),
## Wayland (mixed), wlroots (single library), Sway (multiple
## executables), linux-kernel (executable + files), libxkbcommon
## (balanced 1+1), pixman (single library), and libinput
## (library/executable name collision) precedents: a meson/ninja build
## of upstream cairo fed by a vendored tarball whose sha256 is pinned
## here for deterministic offline test reproduction. cairo emits a
## SINGLE library artifact (``libcairo.so``) — the third single-library
## recipe (wlroots + pixman were the first two), exercising the
## minimal artifact shape against a different upstream + meson option
## set.
##
## ## Why cairo matters for the NDE-H Sway / NDE-G1 GNOME / NDE-K1
## ## Plasma desktop stories
##
## cairo is the 2D vector-graphics library that underpins GTK's
## rendering and pango's text-shaping output surface. The sibling
## ``sway`` recipe pins ``cairo >=1.16`` in its ``uses:`` block
## via its swaybar / swaybg / sway-status helpers, so this recipe is
## the upstream-source side of that dependency edge. Mutter (GNOME)
## and most modern GUI toolkits also link against cairo.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 1.18.4 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/cairo/vendor/cairo-1.18.4.tar.xz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The upstream cairographics.org
## release URL is recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block
## for documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's
## emitted fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 1.18.4 (current upstream stable)
##
## cairographics.org publishes cairo releases at
## ``https://www.cairographics.org/releases/`` and 1.18.4 is the
## current stable in the 1.18.x line as of mid-2026. The cairo ABI
## has been stable since 1.0 — anything ``>=1.16`` covers the sway
## consumption — so tracking current stable is straightforward.
##
## sha256 = 445ed8208a6e4823de1226a74ca319d3600e83f6369f99b14265006599c32ccb
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``cairo-1.18.4.tar.xz``,
##  32,578,804 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded
##  in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Tarball-size caveat — cairo 1.18 ships a large source tree
##
## At ~32 MB compressed, cairo-1.18.4 is the largest source tarball
## in the from-source corpus to date (the prior nine all sit between
## 0.8 MB and 12 MB). The tarball bundles test fixtures (~20 MB of
## reference-image .ref.png files under ``test/reference/``) that the
## ``-Dtests=disabled`` flag below skips at build time but cannot be
## stripped from the upstream source archive itself. This is the same
## tarball nixpkgs's ``pkgs/development/libraries/cairo/default.nix``
## consumes.
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_meson convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``mesonOptions:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``meson setup`` configure BuildAction that depends on the
##      fetch action and passes every flag in ``mesonOptions:`` to
##      ``meson setup``, in declared order.
##   3. a ``ninja`` compile BuildAction (M9.L).
##   4. install/output collection actions for the library artifact
##      (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ninja-spawn + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records the library artifact via the ``library`` block so the
## M9.K artifact registry already knows what shared object to expect.
##
## ## Library artifact
##
## cairo's meson build emits a single shared library
## (``libcairo.so``) bundling all 2D vector-graphics primitives. The
## per-backend code (image, png, ps, pdf, svg) and the font subsystem
## link into the same .so. We intentionally do NOT register the
## auxiliary ``libcairo-script-interpreter`` or ``libcairo-trace``
## libraries — neither is consumed by the v1 desktop story.
##
## We register the artifact under the package-level identifier
## ``libcairo`` (matching the ``libcairo.so`` SONAME upstream ships
## with).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the meson options are hardcoded to the
## modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``tests=disabled``  — skip the upstream test suite (heaviest
##                            portion of the build, not needed at
##                            runtime; matches the other from-source
##                            siblings).
##   * ``xlib=disabled``   — skip the X11 native backend (the v1
##                            desktop story is pure-Wayland and the
##                            xlib backend pulls libX11 + libXrender
##                            into the dependency surface).
##   * ``xcb=disabled``    — skip the XCB native backend for the same
##                            reason as xlib (pulls libxcb +
##                            libxcb-render into the dependency
##                            surface; Wayland-only baseline).
##   * ``--buildtype=release`` — release-mode optimisation; matches
##                              the sibling from-source recipes.
##
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. an X11-enabled variant
## for legacy desktop bundles).

    ## meson is the build-system driver — the c_cpp_meson convention's

    ## freetype is the font-glyph rasteriser cairo's font backends

    ## glib2 ships GObject + GIO surface support for cairo's higher-
    ## level integration. Without an external glib visible via
    ## pkg-config, cairo's meson falls back to a subproject ``wrap``
    ## download of glib 2.74 (M9.R.14h smoke), which triggers the
    ## Python 3.12 ``distutils`` removal at codegen time. Declaring
    ## glib2 here threads the sibling recipe's install-mirror

    ## lands in M9.L when the convention's ninja-spawn + install-glue
    ## closes.

  build:
    ## M9.R.5b — explicit `build:` block constructed from the lifted `config:` values + the inlined verbatim flags. Calls the M9.R.2b high-level `meson_package(...)` constructor.
    ##
    ## M9.R.15e.1 — disable the bundled libpng subproject fallback.
    ## cairo's ``subprojects/libpng.wrap`` provides a libpng-1.6.43
    ## fallback that meson auto-resolves when the external pkg-config
    ## probe for ``libpng16`` fails. The fallback ships a SONAME
    ## ``libpng16.so.16.43.0`` baked into ``libcairo.so.2``'s
    ## ``DT_NEEDED`` entries, while sibling gdk-pixbuf links the
    ## resolver-provisioned external libpng (from ``nixpkgs#libpng``).
    ## At gtk4 link time the two siblings disagree on the libpng
    ## SONAME and the linker fails. Two fixes are applied:
    ##
    ## * ``png=enabled`` — promote PNG support from ``auto`` to
    ##   ``enabled`` so the external probe is required (configure
    ##   hard-fails if the resolver did not provision libpng).
    ## * ``wrap_mode=nofallback`` — disallow any subproject wrap
    ##   download/fallback (meson built-in option). This forbids the
    ##   bundled libpng / glib / freetype / fontconfig / pixman / zlib
    ##   wraps from kicking in and guarantees every dep is satisfied
    ##   through the resolver's ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH``.
