## Source-from-tarball less recipe — the SIXTIETH real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio. less is THE
## canonical Unix pager — every ``man <topic>`` invocation pipes its
## output through ``less``, every ``git log`` / ``git diff`` /
## ``git show`` invocation pipes through ``less`` (git's
## ``core.pager`` defaults to ``less -FRX``), and every shell with
## ``PAGER`` set picks ``less`` by convention.
##
## ## Why less matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## less is the foundation of every terminal-side documentation read.
## Concrete consumers:
##
##   * ``man <topic>`` pipes the formatted manpage through ``less`` so
##     the user can scroll / search the output of any installed
##     package's documentation.
##   * git's pager (``core.pager`` defaults to ``less -FRX``) is the
##     read interface for ``git log`` / ``git diff`` / ``git show``
##     / ``git blame``.
##   * systemd's ``systemctl status`` + ``journalctl`` pipe through
##     less when stdout is a TTY (otherwise they bypass).
##   * The user's interactive shell on a GNOME / Plasma / sway desktop
##     defaults ``PAGER=less`` so every CLI tool with a ``--pager`` /
##     ``--paginate`` flag (e.g. ``htop --help``, ``ip --help``,
##     ``bat`` when piping) finds less on PATH.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 668 .tar.gz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/less/vendor/less-668.tar.gz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The greenwoodsoftware.com
## release URL is recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block
## for documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 668 (current upstream stable)
##
## less releases are cut on greenwoodsoftware.com with a single
## monotonically-increasing integer version (no major/minor). 668 is
## the current stable as of mid-2026; anything ``>=600`` covers the
## modern terminfo / wchar / right-prompt features the v1 desktop's
## ``less -RX`` consumption depends on.
##
## sha256 = 2819f55564d86d542abbecafd82ff61e819a3eec967faa36cd3e68f1596a44b8
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``less-668.tar.gz``,
##  649,770 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into fetch + ``./configure`` + ``make``
## BuildActions; the per-artifact build body + install glue lands in
## M9.L; the recipe records the single executable artifact via the
## ``executable`` block so the M9.K artifact registry already knows
## what binary to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## less's autotools build emits one load-bearing binary from a single
## ``./configure`` + ``make`` invocation:
##
##   * ``less``  — ``/usr/bin/less`` the canonical Unix pager.
##
## NOTE: less also installs ``lessecho`` + ``lesskey`` helper binaries
## under ``/usr/bin/``; v1 only records the canonical pager binary.
## Downstream recipes that need ``lesskey`` to compile a custom
## keymap at install time would lift the artifact registration in a
## follow-up batch.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flag is hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--with-regex=posix`` — pin the regex engine to the POSIX
##                               implementation (vs PCRE / PCRE2 /
##                               GNU regex). POSIX regex is what every
##                               ``/<pattern>`` search in less uses;
##                               PCRE2 would pull in a heavy library
##                               dependency the v1 desktop doesn't
##                               need.
