## Smoke test for the from-source ``less`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the SIXTIETH real production
## from-source recipe. less's unique coverage angle vs the prior
## fifty-nine is being THE canonical Unix pager + a SINGLE-flag
## ``configureFlags:`` block — the smallest configure-channel
## cardinality in the corpus so far, pinning the M9.I block parser's
## one-flag path against potential off-by-one regressions.
##
## Coverage (>=8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the single-flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + cmake + make channels MUST be empty).
##   * SINGLE executable artifact registration (M3) — ``less`` tagged
##     ``dakExecutable``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
