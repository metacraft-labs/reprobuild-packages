## Smoke test for the from-source ``qcoro6`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.R.33.1 production from-source recipe that closes the
## "QCoro6 not found" fresh-configure trip documented in
## ``recipes/reproos-iso/run-evidence/m9r32_complete.txt`` G5.
##
## Coverage (8 check assertions across 6 tests):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) --- URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * Library artifact registration (M3) --- ``libQCoro6Core`` tagged
##     ``dakLibrary``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) --- upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
##   * Runtime closure records the Qt6 Base dependency used by every
##     installed shared library.
