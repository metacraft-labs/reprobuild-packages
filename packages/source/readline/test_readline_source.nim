## Smoke test for the from-source ``readlineSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the SIXTY-FOURTH real
## production from-source recipe. readline's unique coverage angle vs
## the prior sixty-three is being the canonical line-editing library
## paired with bash + gdb + every interactive CLI, plus a TWO-library
## autotools shape (``libreadline`` + ``libhistory``) — the prior
## two-library autotools precedents (nettle's ``libnettle`` +
## ``libhogweed``; ncurses's ``libNcursesw`` + ``libTinfow``) used
## different upstream SONAME pairings, and readline's pair pins the
## paired-history-library convention.
##
## Coverage (>=8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the two-flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + cmake + make channels MUST be empty).
##   * TWO-library artifact registration (M3) — ``libReadline`` +
##     ``libHistory`` both tagged ``dakLibrary``, kind discriminator
##     preserved per-artifact.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
