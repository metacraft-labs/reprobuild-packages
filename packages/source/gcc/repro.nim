## Source-from-tarball gcc recipe — M9.N Batch E compiler-chain slice.
##
## gcc is the GNU Compiler Collection: the canonical host C / C++
## toolchain every from-source recipe under
## ``recipes/packages/source/`` that declares ``uses: "gcc"`` consumes
## at compile + link time. The Batch E (gcc + binutils + make) slice
## sits BELOW Batch D (cmake + autoconf + automake + libtool +
## pkgconf) in the bootstrap layering: every Batch D autotools recipe
## ultimately drives gcc + binutils + make under the hood. R5 musl-tcc
## is the long-term clean root for the bootstrap chain; Batch E ships
## the recipes against the existing upstream tarballs as declarative
## shape so the M9.K convention layer can lower them when the recipe
## graph asks for the host C compiler.
##
## ## Convention chosen — ``from-source-custom``
##
## gcc's upstream build does NOT fit any of the four standard
## ``from-source-*`` conventions (meson / cmake / autotools / make):
##
##   * ``from-source-meson`` requires ``mesonOptions:`` to be populated
##     — gcc has no meson build path.
##   * ``from-source-cmake`` requires ``cmakeFlags:`` populated — gcc
##     is autotools-rooted, not cmake-rooted.
##   * ``from-source-autotools`` requires ``configureFlags:`` populated
##     AND that the ``./configure`` script live at the source root.
##     gcc's canonical build uses an OUT-OF-TREE build directory: the
##     upstream documentation REQUIRES ``mkdir build && cd build &&
##     ../configure ...`` because gcc's in-tree configure would
##     contaminate the source tree with build artefacts that break
##     subsequent re-configures.
##   * ``from-source-make`` requires ``makeFlags:`` populated. gcc
##     drives ``make`` AFTER ``../configure`` lays out the generated
##     ``Makefile``s, but the canonical entry point is the configure
##     driver.
##
## The M9.N Batch C.1 ``from-source-custom`` convention claims this
## recipe via the ``shell()`` action surface on ``build:`` blocks: the
## recipe records the four-shell-action mkdir-configure-build-install
## pipeline as a verbatim shell sequence under the ``gcc`` artifact.
## This mirrors the cmake precedent (the only other ``from-source-
## custom`` consumer in the corpus that drives a multi-shell build).
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## The fetch URL points at the upstream ftp.gnu.org release tarball
## ``gcc-14.2.0.tar.gz``. The sha256 was computed locally by
## downloading the tarball from the canonical ftp.gnu.org release
## endpoint and running ``sha256sum`` over the bytes. nixpkgs's
## ``pkgs/development/compilers/gcc/14/default.nix`` pins gcc 14.x via
## fetchurl + an SRI-hashed mirror URL; the cross-check with the
## upstream sha256 holds when both fetch the same source file.
##
## ## Why gcc is NOT vendored
##
## The ``gcc-14.2.0.tar.gz`` tarball weighs ~160 MB. Per the kernel-recipe
## precedent (``recipes/packages/source/kernel/``), large vendor
## tarballs are NOT checked into the repo — the live ``fetch:`` block
## points at the upstream URL directly and a future vendoring pass
## (R5 musl-tcc) will host the bootstrap-critical archives on a
## reprobuild-managed mirror.
##
## ## Version choice — 14.2.0 (per task brief)
##
## gcc releases are cut on ftp.gnu.org under tags of the form
## ``gcc-<X>.<Y>.<Z>``. 14.2.0 is the latest stable in the 14.x line
## as of the task brief. The 14.x cut introduced the C23 feature set
## the modern desktop story relies on (``[[deprecated]]`` /
## ``constexpr`` / ``typeof`` extensions) and is the stable line the
## Linux 6.6 LTS kernel + the systemd / KDE / Plasma desktop
## components all build against.
##
## ## Build execution
##
## gcc is the LARGEST package in the from-source corpus: the upstream
## tarball weighs ~160 MB, the extracted tree is ~3.5 GB, the build
## consumes substantial disk and memory, and the
## ``--disable-bootstrap`` single-stage build is intentionally fixed
## at eight parallel jobs. The recipe executes the complete
## configure-build-install pipeline and publishes the resulting host
## compiler and runtime libraries.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## gcc exposes three load-bearing CLI binaries + four shared libraries
## on disk (out of the dozens of binaries the upstream install body
## lays out under ``$PREFIX/bin/`` / ``$PREFIX/lib/`` —
## ``cc1`` / ``cc1plus`` / ``collect2`` / ``lto1`` / ... live under
## ``$PREFIX/libexec/`` and are NOT user-facing entry points):
##
##   * ``gcc``       — ``$PREFIX/bin/gcc``, the canonical C compiler
##                      driver every C recipe in
##                      ``recipes/packages/source/`` invokes.
##   * ``g++``       — ``$PREFIX/bin/g++``, the canonical C++ compiler
##                      driver every C++ recipe (kded, kio,
##                      kwidgetsaddons, plasma-framework, qt6-base,
##                      cmake-built consumers) invokes.
##   * ``cpp``       — ``$PREFIX/bin/cpp``, the C preprocessor driver
##                      consumed by autoconf's ``./configure`` probes
##                      and by hand-rolled Makefiles that shell out
##                      to ``cpp -E`` for header expansion.
##   * ``libgcc_s``  — ``$PREFIX/lib/libgcc_s.so``, the GCC runtime
##                      shared library every gcc-produced binary
##                      links against for stack-unwinding + soft-float
##                      helpers + ``__builtin_*`` intrinsics.
##   * ``libstdc++`` — ``$PREFIX/lib/libstdc++.so``, the GNU C++
##                      standard library every g++-produced binary
##                      links against. Re-exposes the ``std::``
##                      namespace + the ABI symbols the C++ ecosystem
##                      pins (libstdc++.so.6 SONAME, GCC_*
##                      versioned-symbol stamps).
##   * ``libgomp``    — ``$PREFIX/lib/libgomp.so``, the OpenMP
##                      runtime used by binaries built with ``-fopenmp``.
##   * ``libatomic``  — ``$PREFIX/lib/libatomic.so``, the fallback
##                      runtime for non-lock-free atomic operations.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables. The configure-pipeline is hardcoded to
## the canonical single-stage build:
##
##   * ``--prefix=$out``           — installs under the per-package
##                                    output dir.
##   * ``--enable-languages=c,c++`` — restrict to C + C++ frontends
##                                    (the desktop story does not
##                                    need Fortran / Ada / Go / D /
##                                    Objective-C).
##   * ``--disable-multilib``       — skip the 32-bit-on-64-bit
##                                    multilib pass (the desktop
##                                    story is x86_64-only).
##   * ``--disable-bootstrap``      — single-stage build; skips the
##                                    triple-recompile self-bootstrap
##                                    pass. Cuts the build time from
##                                    8-12 hours to 2-4 hours; the
##                                    self-bootstrap pass is a
##                                    correctness defence the host
##                                    compiler is already trusted to
##                                    provide.
##   * ``--disable-nls``            — skip the gettext native-language
##                                    support pass. NLS adds a build-
##                                    time dep on libintl and is
##                                    unused on a reproducible-build
##                                    host (no per-locale message
##                                    catalogs to consume).
##   * ``--without-headers``        — skip the libc-headers integration
##                                    pass; the host glibc / musl
##                                    headers already live under
##                                    ``/usr/include`` and gcc's
##                                    ``--with-sysroot`` chain picks
##                                    them up at configure time.
