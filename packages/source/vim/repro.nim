## Source-from-tarball vim recipe — the SIXTY-FIRST real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio. vim is the
## de-facto Unix modal editor — ``/usr/bin/vim`` is the default
## ``EDITOR=`` on every major Linux distribution that does not pin
## emacs, the implicit interpreter every ``vipw`` / ``visudo`` /
## ``crontab -e`` invocation spawns, and the ``$VISUAL`` target every
## interactive script (``git commit``, ``EDITOR=vim git rebase -i``,
## ``EDITOR=vim systemctl edit <unit>``) defers to.
##
## ## Why vim matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## vim is the default modal editor on every Linux distribution that
## doesn't explicitly ship nano as ``/usr/bin/editor``. Concrete
## consumers:
##
##   * ``visudo`` / ``vipw`` / ``vigr`` shell directly into ``vim``
##     (or ``vi`` which is symlinked to vim on every modern distro)
##     to edit ``/etc/sudoers`` / ``/etc/passwd`` / ``/etc/group``
##     atomically.
##   * ``crontab -e`` and ``EDITOR=vim crontab -e`` shell into vim
##     to edit per-user crontabs.
##   * ``git commit`` without ``-m`` spawns ``$GIT_EDITOR`` which
##     falls back to ``$EDITOR`` which defaults to vim on most
##     distros (``vim`` if installed, ``vi`` if vim is missing).
##   * ``systemctl edit <unit>`` spawns ``$SYSTEMD_EDITOR`` which
##     defaults to ``$EDITOR`` which defaults to vim.
##   * GitHub's CLI ``gh`` and Codeberg's ``forgejo`` CLI default to
##     ``$EDITOR`` for PR-body / issue-body editing.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream v9.1.1000 GitHub archive .tar.gz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/vim/vendor/vim-9.1.1000.tar.gz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The github.com archive URL is
## recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 9.1.1000 (current upstream stable)
##
## vim releases are cut on github.com under tags of the form
## ``v<X>.<Y>.<patch>``. The 9.1.x line ships patch-level releases as
## ``v9.1.<patchnumber>``; 9.1.1000 is the current stable as of mid-
## 2026. Anything ``>=9.1`` covers the vim9script language overhaul
## the modern vim plugins (vim-plug, dein.vim, packer.nvim port) use.
##
## sha256 = c8ccd457bba5563513ab3e2088ad10d62b982682af9a9278686b48202b8c7697
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``vim-9.1.1000.tar.gz``,
##  18,393,329 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded
##  in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into fetch + ``./configure`` + ``make``
## BuildActions; the per-artifact build body + install glue lands in
## M9.L; the recipe records the three executable artifacts via the
## ``executable`` blocks so the M9.K artifact registry already knows
## what binaries to expect.
##
## NOTE: vim's GitHub archive's ``configure`` script lives under
## ``src/configure`` (not at the repo root) and the top-level Makefile
## re-dispatches into ``src/`` for the actual build. The c_cpp_autotools
## convention's lowering handles this layout transparently — vim's
## upstream Makefile is autotools-aware and the convention's
## ``./configure`` invocation finds the right script via the symlink
## the top-level Makefile generates on first ``make``.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## vim's autotools build emits three load-bearing binaries from a
## single ``./configure`` + ``make`` invocation:
##
##   * ``vim``       — ``/usr/bin/vim`` the modal editor itself; the
##                      canonical ``EDITOR=`` target on every Linux
##                      distribution.
##   * ``vimdiff``   — ``/usr/bin/vimdiff`` the side-by-side diff /
##                      merge frontend git's ``git mergetool`` defaults
##                      to (``mergetool.vimdiff``). Actually a symlink
##                      to ``vim`` that flips on diff mode at startup;
##                      M9.L's install glue distinguishes the symlink
##                      target via the ``installed-path`` postprocess.
##   * ``vimtutor``  — ``/usr/bin/vimtutor`` the shell-script frontend
##                      that drives the new-user vim tutorial. Bundled
##                      with vim's release on every major distribution.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--enable-gui=no``       — skip the GTK / Athena / Motif GUI
##                                  surface (vim's CLI / TTY interface
##                                  is the only one the v1 desktop
##                                  consumes; GUI vim is replaced by
##                                  gvim which is a separate package
##                                  in the corpus).
##   * ``--without-x``           — skip the libX11 link entirely (no
##                                  X11 clipboard probe at startup;
##                                  v1 desktop uses Wayland and the
##                                  clipboard is handled by wl-clipboard).
##   * ``--with-tlib=ncursesw`` — select the wide-character terminal
##                                  ABI provided by the source-built
##                                  ncurses package.
##   * ``--with-compiledby=ReproOS`` — keep the version banner stable
##                                       across build users and hosts.
##   * ``--disable-gpm``         — skip the GPM (general-purpose-mouse)
##                                  Linux-console mouse-driver
##                                  integration (v1 desktop doesn't
##                                  use Linux-console gpm; mouse input
##                                  in modern terminal emulators comes
##                                  through xterm-mouse protocol).
##   * ``--disable-perlinterp``  — skip the embedded Perl interpreter
##                                  (heavy libperl dependency surface;
##                                  v1 plugin ecosystem prefers
##                                  vim9script + Lua).
##   * ``--disable-pythoninterp`` — skip the embedded Python interpreter
##                                   (heavy libpython dependency surface;
##                                   v1 plugin ecosystem prefers
##                                   vim9script + Lua).
##   * ``--disable-rubyinterp``  — skip the embedded Ruby interpreter
##                                  (heavy libruby dependency surface;
##                                  unused by v1 plugin ecosystem).
##   * ``--disable-luainterp``   — skip the embedded Lua interpreter
##                                  (vim 8+ ships Lua via the Neovim
##                                  compat shim but vim doesn't surface
##                                  it on the v1 desktop). NOTE: this
##                                  intentionally inverts the Neovim
##                                  precedent of bundling Lua —
##                                  Reprobuild's v1 desktop ships
##                                  Neovim separately for Lua-bound
##                                  plugins (treesitter, telescope) and
##                                  vim stays minimal.
##   * ``--disable-libsodium`` / ``--disable-acl`` — prevent optional
##                                  host-library probes from capturing
##                                  undeclared Nix dependencies.
