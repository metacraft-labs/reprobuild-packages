## Smoke test for the from-source ``swaySource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the FIFTH real production
## from-source recipe (predecessors: ``dbusBrokerSource`` /
## ``libdrmSource`` / ``waylandSource`` / ``wlrootsSource``). Sway's
## specific coverage angle vs the prior four is FOUR executable
## artifacts off a meson build whose dependency surface is the WIDEST
## yet (10 entries in ``uses:`` covering meson/ninja/gcc + wlroots +
## wayland-scanner + libxkbcommon + pcre2 + json-c + pango + cairo +
## gdk-pixbuf) — the M2 ``uses:`` round-trip therefore stretches
## across the largest tool / library pin set in the from-source
## cohort, while the M3 artifact registry exercises a four-executable
## fan-out (vs dbus-broker's two).
##
## Coverage:
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``mesonOptions:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (the ``cmake`` channel must NOT see the meson flags).
##   * FOUR executable artifact registration (M3) — ``sway`` +
##     ``swaybar`` + ``swaynag`` + ``swaymsg`` all attributed to
##     ``swaySource`` with kind ``dakExecutable``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
