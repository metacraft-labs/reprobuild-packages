## Source-from-tarball libseat recipe — the LATEST from-source
## production recipe to close M9.R.57's wlroots session-backend gap.
##
## Follows the wlroots (single library), libinput (library + executable),
## pixman (single library), and dbus-broker (executables only)
## precedents: a meson/ninja build of upstream seatd (which ships both
## the ``libseat`` shared library AND the optional ``seatd`` server
## daemon) fed by a vendored tarball whose sha256 is pinned here for
## deterministic offline test reproduction.
##
## ## Why libseat matters for the NDE-H Sway session-backend story
##
## wlroots 0.19+ conditionally compiles its session support on the
## presence of libseat at meson-setup time: without a pkg-config
## visible ``libseat`` the meson build silently disables the session
## code path and every wlroots-based compositor (Sway, labwc, ...)
## boots with:
##
##   ``[wlr] Cannot create session: disabled at compile-time``
##
## M9.R.56.8's boot-smoke evidence
## (``recipes/reproos-image/run-evidence/m9r56/m9r56_8_wayland-session.log``)
## caught exactly this failure inside SDDM's Wayland session launch
## chain. Adding libseat as a sibling from-source recipe + declaring
## it as a wlroots ``buildDeps`` entry closes the last compile-time
## gap in the sddm → pam → wayland-session → sway chain.
##
## ## Upstream project — seatd (contains both libseat + seatd daemon)
##
## Kenny Levinsen's ``seatd`` upstream at
## ``https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/seatd`` ships a single meson
## project that produces THREE build products:
##
##   * ``libseat.so``  — the seat-management client library that
##                       wlroots / KWin / Mutter link against to
##                       reserve DRM devices + tty ownership.
##   * ``seatd``       — the optional standalone seat-management
##                       daemon that hands out DRM device fds to
##                       compositors when systemd-logind is not
##                       available.
##   * ``seatd-launch``— a small helper that spawns the seatd daemon
##                       with a private socket.
##
## For the M9.R.57 NDE-H sway story we ONLY need ``libseat.so``. The
## ReproOS image already runs systemd (M9.R.56 line), so libseat's
## builtin backend (bundled seatd-equivalent driven inside the
## compositor process itself) is sufficient. We disable the standalone
## ``seatd`` server daemon + the ``libseat-logind`` link to systemd
## to keep the dependency surface small; the builtin backend covers
## the Sway compositor's needs.
##
## ## Version choice — 0.9.1 (matches Debian / wlroots 0.19 requirement)
##
## seatd's upstream ship cadence is approximately one point-release per
## quarter; 0.9.1 is the current-line stable that wlroots 0.19 was
## written against (wlroots' meson probe accepts any ABI-compat
## ``libseat >=0.6.0``, so 0.9.1 is safely forward-compatible).
## nixpkgs currently pins ``seatd = 0.9.1`` at
## ``pkgs/os-specific/linux/seatd/default.nix`` as well.
##
## sha256 = 819979c922a0be258aed133d93920bce6a3d3565a60588d6d372ce9db2712cd3
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``seatd-0.9.1.tar.gz``,
##  41,968 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream sr.ht archive URL
##  recorded in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Tarball-source note — sr.ht archive vs upstream release
##
## Upstream ``seatd`` does NOT publish a "release dist" tarball the
## way freedesktop.org projects do; releases are tagged in the git
## repo and the canonical distribution format is sr.ht's per-tag
## ``archive.tar.gz`` (git-archive-equivalent). nixpkgs consumes the
## same URL. The vendored copy at
## ``recipes/packages/source/libseat/vendor/seatd-0.9.1.tar.gz`` is
## byte-identical to what sr.ht serves; the recipe references it via
## a file:// URL for offline reproduction.
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_meson convention (M9.K) reads the ``fetch:`` block and
## the inline ``mesonOptions`` (via the M9.R.5b explicit ``build:``
## block) and lowers them into fetch + configure + compile + install
## BuildActions. The recipe declares a single ``library libseat``
## artifact for ``libseat.so``; the M9.L install glue resolves it to
## ``$prefix/lib/libseat.so*``.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the meson options are hardcoded to a
## minimal-libseat baseline per the M9.R.57 task brief:
##
##   * ``libseat-seatd=enabled``   — M9.R.58.2: enable the seatd
##                                    daemon IPC backend. This is
##                                    the primary backend the
##                                    ReproOS image uses (bypassing
##                                    logind, which can't complete
##                                    CreateSession without a
##                                    dbus-with-libsystemd build).
##   * ``libseat-logind=disabled`` — skip the systemd-logind backend
##                                    link; keeps libseat.so from
##                                    linking libsystemd (which would
##                                    pull in a large transitive
##                                    dependency graph). The builtin
##                                    backend covers Sway's needs.
##   * ``libseat-builtin=enabled`` — enable the builtin backend
##                                    (bundled seatd equivalent
##                                    inside libseat itself); this is
##                                    the ONLY backend the recipe
##                                    ships.
##   * ``server=enabled``          — M9.R.58.2: build the standalone
##                                    seatd daemon + seatd-launch
##                                    helper. A systemd unit
##                                    installed by the reproos-image
##                                    build runs the daemon before
##                                    sddm.service.
##   * ``examples=disabled``       — skip the example seat clients.
##   * ``man-pages=disabled``      — skip man page generation (no
##                                    scdoc dependency).
##   * ``--buildtype=release``     — release-mode optimisation;
##                                    matches the sibling from-source
##                                    recipes.
