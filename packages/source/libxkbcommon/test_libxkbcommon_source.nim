## Smoke test for the from-source ``libxkbcommonSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the SEVENTH real production
## from-source recipe (predecessors: ``dbusBrokerSource`` /
## ``libdrmSource`` / ``waylandSource`` / ``wlrootsSource`` /
## ``swaySource`` / ``linuxKernelSource``). libxkbcommon's unique
## coverage angle vs the prior six is a BALANCED library + executable
## split (1 lib + 1 exe) — Wayland was 3 libs + 1 exe (imbalanced), so
## the M3 artifact registry's per-package kind discriminator is
## stretched in a fresh shape.
##
## Coverage (8 check assertions across 7 tests):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``mesonOptions:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (the ``cmake`` channel must NOT see the meson flags).
##   * BALANCED library + executable artifact registration (M3) —
##     ``libxkbcommon`` tagged ``dakLibrary`` and ``xkbcli`` tagged
##     ``dakExecutable`` in a single package's artifact set.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
