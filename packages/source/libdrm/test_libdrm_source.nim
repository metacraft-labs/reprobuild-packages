## Smoke test for the from-source ``libdrmSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the SECOND real production
## from-source recipe (the first was ``dbusBrokerSource``). Where the
## dbus-broker test exercised executable artifacts, this one exercises
## the M3 ``library`` artifact family — both kinds plug into the same
## artifact registry but the kind discriminator differs (dakLibrary vs
## dakExecutable), so a regression that flattened the kind discriminator
## would surface differently here than in the dbus-broker smoke test.
##
## Coverage:
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``mesonOptions:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (the ``cmake`` channel must NOT see the meson flags).
##   * ``library`` artifact registration (M3) — three libraries, all
##     tagged ``dakLibrary``, all attributed to ``libdrmSource``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
