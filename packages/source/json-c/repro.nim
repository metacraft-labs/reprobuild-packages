## Source-from-tarball json-c recipe — the THIRTEENTH real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio and the FIRST recipe
## to drive the ``cmakeFlags:`` channel instead of ``mesonOptions:``.
##
## Prior twelve from-source recipes (dbus-broker, libdrm, wayland,
## wlroots, sway, linux-kernel, libxkbcommon, pixman, libinput, cairo,
## pango, gdk-pixbuf) all use either ``mesonOptions:`` (eleven of them)
## or ``makeFlags:`` (the kernel). json-c is the first CMake-driven
## upstream in the recipe suite, so it pins the M9.I per-channel
## isolation property from the OPPOSITE side from the meson recipes: a
## regression that misroutes a CMake flag onto the meson channel would
## surface in the dedicated channel-isolation pin in
## ``test_json_c_source.nim``.
##
## ## Why json-c matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## json-c is a C JSON parser + serialiser library used by a wide swath
## of system-level tooling (e.g. swayipc helpers, sway's wallpaper-
## config helpers, NetworkManager, BlueZ, PolicyKit). It is a
## transitive dependency of every JSON-aware desktop component and is
## consumed by the sway ecosystem for IPC message construction. The
## sibling ``swaySource`` recipe pins ``json-c >=0.17`` in its
## ``uses:`` block (added when the desktop story closes), so this
## recipe is the upstream-source side of that dependency edge.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 0.18-20240915 .tar.gz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/json-c/vendor/json-c-0.18-20240915.tar.gz``
## and reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The github.com release URL
## is recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's
## emitted fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 0.18-20240915 (current upstream stable)
##
## json-c releases are dated snapshots cut on the GitHub repository
## under tags of the form ``json-c-<api-version>-<YYYYMMDD>``. The
## ``0.18-20240915`` tag is the current stable in the 0.18.x line as
## of mid-2026 and the ABI is stable since the 0.17 cut — anything
## ``>=0.17`` covers the sway consumption.
##
## sha256 = 3112c1f25d39eca661fe3fc663431e130cc6e2f900c081738317fba49d29e298
##  (computed locally over the vendored
##  ``json-c-0.18-20240915.tar.gz``, 401,874 bytes; downloaded once
##  from the upstream URL recorded in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_cmake convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``cmakeFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``cmake`` configure BuildAction that depends on the fetch
##      action and passes every flag in ``cmakeFlags:`` to
##      ``cmake -S <src> -B <build>``, in declared order.
##   3. a ``ninja`` (or ``cmake --build``) compile BuildAction (M9.L).
##   4. install/output collection actions for the library artifact
##      (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ninja-spawn + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records the library artifact via the ``library`` block so the
## M9.K artifact registry already knows what shared object to expect.
##
## ## Library artifact
##
## json-c's CMake build emits a single shared library
## (``libjson-c.so``) bundling the JSON parser + writer + tree
## walker + tokener + utility helpers. We register the artifact under
## the package-level identifier ``libJsonC`` (the kebab-cased
## ``-c`` suffix is stripped from the artifact identifier and the
## camel-case mapping follows the gdk-pixbuf precedent of
## kebab-to-camel for ``json-c`` -> ``jsonCSource``).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the CMake options are hardcoded to the
## modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON``    — build the shared object (consumed
##                                    by sway helpers + NetworkManager
##                                    + BlueZ + PolicyKit).
##   * ``BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=OFF``   — skip the static archive (not used
##                                    by the v1 desktop story; cuts
##                                    build time + cache size).
##   * ``BUILD_TESTING=OFF``       — skip the upstream test suite to
##                                    keep the build hermetic + fast.
##   * ``BUILD_APPS=OFF``          — skip the bundled apps
##                                    (``json_parse`` + ``test_*``)
##                                    that are not needed at runtime.
##   * ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`` — release-mode optimisation;
##                                    matches the sibling from-source
##                                    recipes' ``--buildtype=release``
##                                    meson option.
##
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. a developer variant that
## flips ``BUILD_TESTING=ON`` for CI bundles).
