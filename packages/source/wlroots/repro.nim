## Source-from-tarball wlroots recipe — the FOURTH real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio
## (fetch: + mesonOptions: + convention-layer fetch-action emission).
##
## Follows the dbus-broker (executables only), libdrm (libraries only),
## and Wayland (mixed) precedents: a meson/ninja build of upstream
## wlroots fed by a vendored tarball whose sha256 is pinned here for
## deterministic offline test reproduction. wlroots is a single
## shared-library output (``libwlroots.so``) — the modular Wayland
## compositor library that Sway, labwc, and roughly every wlroots-based
## Wayland compositor in the ecosystem link against.
##
## ## Why wlroots matters for the NDE-H Sway desktop story
##
## ``recipes/packages/desktop-environments/sway/repro.nim`` ships the
## NDE-H Sway compositor's user-facing glue. Sway is wlroots' canonical
## upstream consumer — upstream Sway versions pin a specific wlroots
## stable line (0.18 / 0.19 / 0.20) and won't compile against any
## other. This recipe is the upstream-source side of that pairing.
## The wlroots library exposes the backend (DRM/KMS, libinput, X11),
## renderer (GLES2/Vulkan), scene graph, and protocol implementations
## that every wlroots-based compositor needs; without this recipe the
## NDE-H story has a dangling wlroots dependency.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 0.19.3 .tar.gz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/wlroots/vendor/wlroots-0.19.3.tar.gz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The upstream gitlab releases
## URL is recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's
## emitted fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 0.19.3 (= nixpkgs ``wlroots_0_19``)
##
## wlroots ships multiple parallel stable lines; nixpkgs currently
## pins both ``wlroots_0_19 = 0.19.3`` and ``wlroots_0_20 = 0.20.1``
## at ``pkgs/development/libraries/wlroots/default.nix``. We follow
## the 0.19 line because that's the version upstream Sway 1.11.x
## links against — picking 0.20 would orphan the NDE-H Sway recipe
## downstream. A future bump can flip to 0.20 in lockstep with the
## Sway pin once upstream Sway moves.
##
## ## Tarball-source caveat — release dist vs git archive
##
## Unlike nixpkgs (which uses ``fetchFromGitLab`` against the tag),
## we follow the task brief and vendor the official release dist
## tarball published under
## ``https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/releases/0.19.3/downloads/wlroots-0.19.3.tar.gz``.
## The dist tarball and the GitLab-generated git-archive have
## different sha256 hashes — the dist tarball is the canonical
## upstream-published artifact and is what packaging ecosystems
## outside Nix consume. nixpkgs's ``sha256-J+wSVUtuizaCyCn523chFbE8VtbPjyu5XYv5eLT+GM0=``
## therefore CANNOT be byte-cross-checked against our vendored copy
## (different upstream artifact); the version cross-check still
## holds (both pin 0.19.3 as the latest 0.19 stable).
##
## sha256 = 5d02693175e5afd9af5f10e3e4976d6e9249dc39a90eb17d23fa5f54b125ccc5
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``wlroots-0.19.3.tar.gz``,
##  671,529 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_meson convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``mesonOptions:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``meson setup`` configure BuildAction that depends on the
##      fetch action and passes every flag in ``mesonOptions:`` to
##      ``meson setup``, in declared order.
##   3. a ``ninja`` compile BuildAction (M9.L).
##   4. install/output collection actions for the library artifact
##      (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ninja-spawn + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records the library artifact via the ``library`` block so the
## M9.K artifact registry already knows what shared object to expect.
##
## ## Library artifact
##
## wlroots produces a single shared library — ``libwlroots.so`` — that
## bundles the backend, renderer, scene graph, and protocol
## implementations. Unlike libdrm (which splits the per-vendor side
## libraries) or Wayland (which splits client/server/cursor), wlroots'
## meson build keeps everything in one .so. The per-backend / per-API
## toggles are flipped via mesonOptions below rather than producing
## separate artifacts.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the meson options are hardcoded to a
## desktop-baseline set per the task brief:
##
##   * ``examples=false``       — skip the upstream example
##                                 compositors (TinyWL et al); they
##                                 are not consumed by Sway / labwc
##                                 and would bloat the build.
##   * ``xwayland=disabled``    — disable XWayland support to keep
##                                 the dependency surface small (the
##                                 X11 server is a heavy transitive
##                                 dep that NDE-H Sway does not need
##                                 in its v1 hermetic shape).
##   * ``xcb-errors=disabled``  — companion to the XWayland-off
##                                 setting; xcb-errors is only used
##                                 by the XWayland codepath.
##   * ``werror=false``         — modern compilers add new warnings
##                                 over time; ``-Werror`` makes the
##                                 build version-fragile across
##                                 toolchain bumps.
##   * ``--buildtype=release``  — release-mode optimisation; matches
##                                 the dbus-broker / libdrm / Wayland
##                                 sibling recipes.
##
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. an X11-enabled variant
## that flips XWayland back on, or a developer variant that enables
## examples + Werror for upstream testing).

package wlroots:
  ## From-source wlroots — fourth M9.H/I/K production recipe.
  ##
  ## Tier-2b c_cpp_meson convention consumer: the convention layer
  ## reads the ``fetch:`` block (registered via ``registeredFetchSpec``)
  ## and the ``mesonOptions:`` block (registered via
  ## ``registeredBuildFlags`` on the ``"meson"`` channel) and lowers
  ## them into fetch + configure BuildActions wired with the right
  ## URL + hash + flags.

  versions:
    ## Pinned upstream tag. ``sourceUrl`` records the canonical
    ## freedesktop.org gitlab release tarball URL so a future

    ## wayland (= libwayland-client + libwayland-server) is the
    ## protocol library every wlroots compositor consumes for its
    ## server-side endpoints.
    "wayland >=1.22"
    ## wayland-scanner is the protocol-XML → C marshalling-stub
    ## generator from the Wayland package; wlroots' meson build
    ## invokes it during configure / compile to emit protocol stubs.
    ## Recipe name ``wayland`` matches the sibling source recipe — the
    ## scanner is a sub-artefact of the wayland tarball, not a
    ## separate package.

    ## pixman is the 2D pixel-manipulation library used by wlroots'

    ## libinput is the input-device abstraction library wlroots'
    ## libinput backend wraps for evdev / touchpad / tablet support.

    ## wayland-protocols ships the protocol-XML files (xdg-shell,
    ## linux-dmabuf, pointer-constraints, ...) that wlroots' build
    ## consumes at compile time to emit protocol-stub C bindings.
    ## Distributed as a separate upstream package from libwayland;
    ## the stdlib shim ``wayland_protocols.nim`` exposes the nixpkgs
    ## provisioning. Without this dep, wlroots' meson setup fails at
    ## ``src/protocol/meson.build:1:17`` because wlroots tries to
    ## fall back to a subproject clone when the pkg-config probe
    ## misses and wrap-based downloads are disabled.
    "wayland-protocols"
    ## libseat is the seat-management client library wlroots' session
    ## backend links against to reserve DRM devices + tty ownership.
    ## Without libseat on pkg-config, wlroots' meson probe at
    ## ``backend/session/meson.build:3`` fails silently and the
    ## session backend is compiled out entirely — every wlroots-based
    ## compositor then aborts at ``wlr_session_create()`` with
    ## ``[wlr] Cannot create session: disabled at compile-time`` (as
    ## M9.R.56.8's boot smoke caught). M9.R.57.1 ships the libseat
    ## sibling from-source recipe; M9.R.57.2 declares it here so
    ## wlroots picks it up during the next recipe-revision rebuild.
    "libseat >=0.6.0"
    ## libudev is the second half of wlroots' session-backend
    ## dependency pair (see ``backend/session/meson.build:2``). The
    ## meson build gates session support behind
    ## ``if not (udev.found() and libseat.found())`` so BOTH must
    ## resolve — otherwise ``features += { 'session': true }`` never
    ## fires and the compiled-out ``Cannot create session: disabled
    ## at compile-time`` runtime abort returns. libudev's stdlib
    ## provisioning routes to ``nixpkgs#systemd^*``; libinput already
    ## resolves it transitively for its own build but wlroots'
    ## direct probe needs it declared here explicitly.
    "libudev >=232"
    ## mesa provides libgbm.so (the Generic Buffer Manager the DRM
    ## backend uses to allocate scanout buffers) and libEGL /
    ## libGLESv2 (the GLES2 renderer). Without mesa, wlroots' meson
    ## probe at ``backend/drm/meson.build:1`` fails and BOTH the
    ## drm-backend + gles2-renderer + gbm-allocator features are
    ## compiled out — every wlroots-based compositor then aborts
    ## with ``Cannot create DRM backend: disabled at compile-time``
    ## + ``Failed to open any DRM device`` at
    ## ``backend/backend.c:276``. M9.R.58.4 adds mesa here to close
    ## the last wlroots compile-time gate after M9.R.57 (libseat)
    ## + M9.R.58 (seatd daemon) closed the runtime chain.
    ##
    ## Note: mesa installs gbm.pc under ``usr/lib64/pkgconfig/``
    ## (M9.R.13's meson ``libdir=lib64`` pin); wlroots' pkg-config
    ## search path includes both usr/lib/pkgconfig and

    ## hwdata provides the ``pnp.ids`` EISA PnP vendor lookup table
    ## that wlroots' DRM backend meson probe consumes at build time
    ## via ``hwdata.get_variable(pkgconfig: 'pkgdatadir')``
    ## (backend/drm/meson.build:1-25). Without hwdata, wlroots'
    ## meson-log emits ``Build-time dependency hwdata found: NO`` and
    ## the DRM subdir short-circuits at ``if not (hwdata.found() and
    ## libdisplay_info.found() and features['session'])``. The
    ## ``gen_pnpids.sh`` script synthesizes a per-vendor lookup
    ## table (``backend/drm/pnpids.c``) linked into libwlroots.so
    ## for the monitor-EDID vendor lookup codepath.
    ##
    ## M9.R.59.1 adds hwdata as a sibling from-source recipe; this
    ## edge closes the FIRST of the two DRM-backend meson probe
    ## dependencies M9.R.58.4's evidence flagged as missing.

    ## Without libdisplay-info, wlroots' meson-log emits ``Run-time

    ## compiled out entirely (matching the runtime abort

    ## M9.R.58.4's boot smoke caught).
