## Smoke test for the from-source ``wlrootsSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the FOURTH real production
## from-source recipe (predecessors: ``dbusBrokerSource`` /
## ``libdrmSource`` / ``waylandSource``). wlroots' specific coverage
## angle vs the prior three is a SINGLE library artifact off a meson
## build whose dependency surface is wider than libdrm's (it pulls
## libdrm, Wayland, libxkbcommon, pixman, libinput together) — the M2
## ``uses:`` round-trip therefore stretches across eight tool / library
## pins, where the libdrm sibling has three.
##
## Coverage:
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``mesonOptions:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (the ``cmake`` channel must NOT see the meson flags).
##   * SINGLE library artifact registration (M3) — ``libwlroots``
##     attributed to ``wlrootsSource`` with kind ``dakLibrary``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
