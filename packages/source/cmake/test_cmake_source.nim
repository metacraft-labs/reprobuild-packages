## Smoke test for the from-source ``cmakeSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I + M3 registry behaviour on the M9.N Batch D
## build-tool slice. cmake's unique coverage angles vs the prior 76
## from-source recipes:
##
##   * FIRST recipe in the corpus to declare THREE ``executable``
##     artifacts sharing a single ``./bootstrap && make && make
##     install`` install-tree (cmake + ctest + cpack). Pins the
##     ``from-source-custom`` convention's per-artifact stage-copy
##     fan-out from a multi-binary install-tree.
##   * SECOND ``from-source-custom`` consumer with a multi-shell
##     ``build:`` block (vs ``mesonSource``'s four-shell install body)
##     — pins the M9.N Batch C.1 shell-action registry round-trip on a
##     bootstrap-build-install pipeline.
##   * Real sha256 on the fetch channel — the test asserts the exact
##     64-char hex hash recorded in the recipe + the algorithm tag.
##
## Coverage (>=8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * No-flags state on ALL FOUR build channels (M9.I) — configure +
##     meson + cmake + make all empty.
##   * THREE ``executable`` artifact registration (M3) — cmake +
##     ctest + cpack all tagged ``dakExecutable``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
##   * ``shell()`` action registry round-trip (M9.N Batch C.1) — three
##     verbatim commands recorded in declaration order under the
##     ``cmake`` artifact.
