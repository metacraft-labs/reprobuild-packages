## Source-from-tarball cmake recipe — M9.N Batch D build-tool slice.
##
## cmake is a meta-build system: the upstream tarball ships a hand-
## rolled ``./bootstrap`` driver that compiles a minimal cmake binary
## from the bundled C++ sources, then runs the freshly-built binary
## against the full source tree to drive the canonical
## ``configure / build / install`` cycle. The on-disk artefacts are
## three CLI binaries (``cmake`` + ``ctest`` + ``cpack``).
##
## ## Convention chosen — ``from-source-custom``
##
## cmake's upstream build does NOT fit any of the four standard
## ``from-source-*`` conventions (meson / cmake / autotools / make):
##
##   * ``from-source-meson`` requires ``uses:`` to list ``meson`` AND
##     ``mesonOptions:`` to be populated.
##   * ``from-source-cmake`` requires ``cmakeFlags:`` populated — and
##     we'd be bootstrapping cmake via cmake, which is the chicken-and-
##     egg.
##   * ``from-source-autotools`` requires ``configureFlags:`` populated
##     AND the existence of an autotools-style ``./configure`` script —
##     cmake's ``./bootstrap`` is a bespoke shell driver, NOT an
##     autoconf-generated script.
##   * ``from-source-make`` requires ``makeFlags:`` populated. cmake's
##     bootstrap runs ``make`` AFTER ``./bootstrap`` lays out the
##     generated ``Makefile``s, but the canonical entry point is the
##     bootstrap driver.
##
## The M9.N Batch C.1 ``from-source-custom`` convention claims this
## recipe via the ``shell()`` action surface on ``build:`` blocks: the
## recipe records the three-shell-action bootstrap-build-install
## pipeline as a verbatim shell sequence.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## The fetch URL points at the upstream cmake.org release tarball
## ``cmake-3.31.2.tar.gz``. The sha256 was computed locally by
## downloading the tarball from the canonical GitHub release endpoint
## and running ``sha256sum`` over the bytes. nixpkgs's by-name
## ``cm/cmake/package.nix`` pins cmake 4.1.2 with SRI
## ``sha256-ZD8EGCt7oyOrMfUm94UTT7ecujGIqFIgbvBHP+4oKhU=``, NOT the
## 3.31.2 release the task brief requests, so the nixpkgs cross-check
## is deferred to the follow-up pass that lifts cmake to nixpkgs's
## 4.x line.
##
## ## Version choice — 3.31.2 (per task brief)
##
## cmake releases are cut on github.com/Kitware/CMake under tags of
## the form ``v<X>.<Y>.<Z>``. 3.31.2 was the latest stable in the
## 3.31.x line as of the task brief. The 3.31 cut introduced the new
## ``cmake --workflow`` driver + the stabilised CXX module support;
## anything ``>=3.25`` covers every consumer's modern-cmake pinning.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## cmake exposes three load-bearing CLI binaries on disk:
##
##   * ``cmake`` — ``$PREFIX/bin/cmake``, the meta-build driver every
##                  C / C++ recipe in ``recipes/packages/source/`` that
##                  declares ``uses: "cmake"`` invokes at configure +
##                  build + install time (kded, kio, kwidgetsaddons,
##                  plasma-framework, json-c, ...).
##   * ``ctest`` — ``$PREFIX/bin/ctest``, the test-runner sidecar the
##                  cmake-generated build trees invoke for
##                  ``cmake --build . --target test``.
##   * ``cpack`` — ``$PREFIX/bin/cpack``, the packaging sidecar that
##                  generates distribution archives (.tar.gz, .deb,
##                  .rpm, .nsis, .dmg) from a configured cmake project.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables. The bootstrap pipeline is hardcoded to
## ``./bootstrap --prefix=$out -- -DCMAKE_USE_OPENSSL=OFF
## -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libidn2=ON``:
##
##   * ``--prefix=$out``               — installs under the per-package
##                                        output dir the from-source-
##                                        custom convention substitutes
##                                        at emit time.
##   * ``-DCMAKE_USE_OPENSSL=OFF``     — skip the OpenSSL link
##                                        (cmake's ``file(DOWNLOAD)``
##                                        HTTPS support uses libcurl
##                                        which can be linked against
##                                        either OpenSSL or BearSSL;
##                                        skipping the OpenSSL channel
##                                        cuts the build-time dependency
##                                        surface on the bootstrap host).
##   * ``-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF``         — omit upstream self-tests from
##                                        the package build; ReproOS consumes
##                                        the installed command-line tools.
##   * ``-DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Libidn2=ON``
##                                      — keep bundled curl from probing an
##                                        ambient libidn2 whose transitive
##                                        libunistring dependency may not be
##                                        present in the build profile. The
##                                        vendored curl overrides its own
##                                        ``USE_LIBIDN2`` option, so disabling
##                                        discovery is the effective control.
