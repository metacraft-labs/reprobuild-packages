## Smoke test for the from-source ``ncursesSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the SIXTY-SECOND real
## production from-source recipe. ncurses's unique coverage angle vs
## the prior sixty-one is being THE canonical Unix terminal-UI library
## + the FIRST source recipe in the corpus to ship a TWO-library +
## TWO-executable mixed-kind shape from a single autotools
## ``./configure`` + ``make`` invocation (the prior precedents — libcap
## one-lib + three-exec, procps one-lib + five-exec — covered the
## library/executable mix at different cardinalities but not the
## TWO-of-each balance).
##
## Coverage (>=8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production six-flag set +
##     channel-isolation spot-check (meson + cmake + make channels
##     MUST be empty).
##   * FOUR artifact registration (M3) — ``libNcursesw`` + ``libTinfow``
##     tagged ``dakLibrary`` + ``tic`` + ``infocmp`` tagged
##     ``dakExecutable``, all in the same package's artifact set.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
