## Source-from-tarball glibc recipe — the FORTY-SECOND real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio. glibc is the
## CANONICAL C library + dynamic linker every glibc-flavoured Linux
## userland binary links against. This is the **full glibc from
## source**, complementing the existing R5/R6 bootstrap glibc-2.42
## wrappers in ``recipes/bootstrap/tcc-chain/`` (which lift only the
## minimal subset needed to bootstrap a working compiler from hex0).
## The from-source recipe here builds the full library family
## (libc + libm + libpthread + libdl + librt + libcrypt + ld-linux) +
## ships the dynamic linker as an executable artifact.
##
## ## Why glibc matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## glibc is the foundation of every glibc-flavoured Linux userland.
## Every binary in /usr/bin links against libc.so.6, every floating-
## point-heavy binary links against libm.so.6, every threaded binary
## links against libpthread.so.0 (recently merged into libc.so.6 since
## glibc 2.34 but the SONAME stays for back-compat), every plugin-
## loading binary links against libdl.so.2, every clock-using binary
## links against librt.so.1, and every password-handling binary links
## against libcrypt.so.1. The dynamic linker (``ld-linux-x86-64.so.2``)
## is what the kernel hands every dynamically-linked ELF to at exec
## time. The musl-flavoured Linux userland is OUT OF SCOPE for v1 — the
## reproos-mvp target is a glibc Debian/Ubuntu-equivalent userland.
##
## ## Relationship to the R5/R6 bootstrap glibc
##
## The bootstrap glibc-2.42 wrappers under
## ``recipes/bootstrap/tcc-chain/`` lift only the minimal C library
## surface needed to bootstrap a working compiler from hex0 → tcc →
## gcc. They DO NOT ship libm / libpthread / libdl / librt / libcrypt
## and they DO NOT register the dynamic linker as a typed artifact.
## This recipe is the complement: the FULL glibc build that closes
## the foundation tier for the desktop story. The two coexist in the
## package universe — the bootstrap recipes are consumed by the lift
## chain only; everything downstream of the lifted gcc consumes the
## full glibc registered HERE.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## The upstream 2.42 .tar.xz is fetched from ftp.gnu.org and pinned by its
## sha256. Once fetched, reprobuild's content-addressed source cache makes
## subsequent builds independent of the network.
##
## ## Version choice — 2.42
##
## glibc releases are cut on sourceware.org under tags of the form
## ``glibc-<X>.<Y>``. 2.42 matches the repository development toolchain and
## bootstrap wrappers while remaining backward-compatible with packages built
## against glibc 2.40. The 2.34 cut folded libpthread, libdl, and librt into
## libc.so.6 while preserving their compatibility SONAMEs.
##
## sha256 = d1775e32e4628e64ef930f435b67bb63af7599acb6be2b335b9f19f16509f17f
##  (computed locally over the upstream ``glibc-2.42.tar.xz`` release).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into fetch + ``./configure`` + ``make``
## BuildActions. NOTE: glibc's upstream build convention is to run
## ``./configure`` from a SEPARATE build directory (not in-tree); the
## M9.L convention layer will need to wire that knob when the per-
## artifact body lands. The recipe records the artifacts via the
## ``library`` / ``executable`` blocks so the M9.K artifact registry
## already knows what shared objects + the dynamic linker to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
##   * ``libC`` (library)        — ``libc.so.6`` the canonical C runtime
##                                  library every glibc binary links
##                                  against.
##   * ``libM`` (library)        — ``libm.so.6`` the math library every
##                                  float-using binary links against.
##   * ``libPthread`` (library)  — ``libpthread.so.0`` the POSIX
##                                  threads library (since 2.34 a
##                                  back-compat stub forwarding into
##                                  libc.so.6 but still a separate
##                                  SONAME).
##   * ``libDl`` (library)       — ``libdl.so.2`` the dynamic-loader
##                                  ABI library (same 2.34 fold-in
##                                  caveat as libpthread).
##   * ``libRt`` (library)       — ``librt.so.1`` the POSIX real-time
##                                  library (clocks + timers +
##                                  message queues; same 2.34 fold-in
##                                  caveat).
##   * ``libCrypt`` (library)    — ``libcrypt.so.1`` the password-
##                                  hashing library (crypt() family).
##                                  Note: glibc 2.42 still ships libcrypt
##                                  in-tree but the longer-term plan
##                                  upstream is to migrate to libxcrypt
##                                  (out-of-tree); v1 uses the in-tree
##                                  build.
##   * ``ldso`` (executable)     — ``/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`` the
##                                  dynamic linker the kernel hands every
##                                  dynamically-linked ELF at exec time.
##                                  Registered as an executable artifact
##                                  because it IS executable (the kernel
##                                  exec()'s it directly) — distinct from
##                                  the libraries that the linker
##                                  resolves.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to the
## modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--disable-werror``           — turn off ``-Werror`` so a host
##                                       gcc version newer than the
##                                       tested-by-upstream set doesn't
##                                       fail the build on new warnings.
##   * ``--enable-bind-now``          — link the dynamic libraries with
##                                       ``BIND_NOW`` so symbol
##                                       resolution happens at load time
##                                       (eliminates the lazy-binding
##                                       JIT-shaped attack surface).
##   * ``--enable-stack-protector=strong``
##                                    — enable the gcc stack-smashing
##                                       protector at "strong" level
##                                       across glibc's own internal
##                                       code (modern hardening).
##   * ``--enable-kernel=4.19``       — set the minimum supported kernel
##                                       at 4.19 (LTS branch covering
##                                       every supported host); skip the
##                                       compatibility paths for older
##                                       kernels.
##   * ``--without-selinux``          — skip the libselinux dependency
##                                       (v1 desktop is non-SELinux; the
##                                       Plasma/GNOME stacks use
##                                       PolicyKit + AppArmor instead).
