## Source-from-tarball boost recipe — the FIRST custom-build C++ multi-module
## library to land in the from-source corpus.
##
## Boost (boostorg/boost) is the de-facto C++ standard-library extension
## the modern Linux desktop stack consumes for:
##
##   * ``Boost.System``      — error-category framework Plasma's
##                              libplasma-activities QML plugin runtime + a
##                              long tail of KDE Frameworks 6 modules link
##                              against.
##   * ``Boost.Filesystem``  — directory-walking + path-arithmetic surface
##                              consumed by libplasma-activities + several
##                              consumer apps in the Plasma 6 line.
##   * ``Boost.Thread``      — kept on by default because libplasma-activities
##                              + a handful of other Plasma 6 modules link
##                              ``boost::thread``.
##   * ``Boost.DateTime``    — date / time formatting consumed by KDE
##                              Frameworks 6 archive + JSON helpers.
##   * ``Boost.ProgramOptions`` — CLI-flag parser consumed by ``boost::asio``
##                                 helpers in upstream demos and a small
##                                 number of KDE Frameworks 6 internal tools.
##
## ## Why boost matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## ``find_package(Boost <ver> REQUIRED)`` is the single largest blocker on
## the plasma-activities CMakeLists; plasma-activities is the prereq for
## plasma-framework's ``find_package(PlasmaActivities REQUIRED)``, and
## plasma-framework is the prereq for kwin, plasma-workspace, and sddm.
## Closing the boost recipe unblocks the entire Plasma 6 desktop chain.
##
## ## Why the custom build shape (not ``cmake_package``)
##
## Boost ships TWO upstream build paths:
##
##   1. ``bootstrap.sh`` + ``./b2 install`` — the historical Boost build
##      driver; produces every shipping Boost library + headers without any
##      external dependency on CMake or autotools.
##   2. ``cmake`` super-build — Boost's modern but still-experimental CMake
##      entrypoint; requires every individual Boost component to opt in via
##      its own ``CMakeLists.txt``, with several modules still missing or
##      broken on 1.86.0.
##
## Path 1 is the canonical, upstream-endorsed shape on Linux and the only
## build path the nixpkgs / Debian / Fedora packages drive. Path 2 is
## experimental and explicitly NOT recommended for v1.86.0 in the upstream
## release notes. We take Path 1 — same shape as the gcc recipe (M9.N Batch
## E): a per-artifact ``build:`` block with verbatim ``shell()`` actions
## wired through the ``from-source-custom`` convention.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## Live upstream URL — boost_1_86_0.tar.bz2 weighs ~126 MB which is well
## past the github.com 100-MB single-file ceiling, so the kernel- /
## gcc-recipe precedent applies: live URL, no vendor/ copy. A future R5
## musl-tcc pass will host the bootstrap-critical archives on a reprobuild-
## managed mirror.
##
## sha256 was computed locally over the upstream archives.boost.io tarball
## (126,220,652 bytes); the hash matches the upstream-published hash
## (``boost_1_86_0.tar.bz2.json``).
##
## ## Version choice — 1.86.0 (current stable in the 1.86.x line)
##
## Boost cuts a release every ~4 months under ``boost_<X>_<Y>_<Z>``
## tag-flavoured tarball names. 1.86.0 (released 2024-08-14) is a current
## stable release; plasma-activities's ``find_package(Boost 1.49 REQUIRED)``
## floor is satisfied by anything ``>= 1.49``.
##
## ## Build shape — bootstrap-b2-stage-copy
##
## Three shell actions drive the build (mirrored on the libBoostSystem
## anchor artifact per the gcc multi-artifact precedent — sibling library
## artifacts share the same install-tree and ship empty build bodies):
##
##   1. ``./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$out --with-libraries=...`` — runs the
##      Boost.Build (``b2``) bootstrap; produces a ``./b2`` driver at the
##      source root and a ``project-config.jam`` honouring the per-library
##      filter list.
##   2. ``./b2 install --prefix=$out link=shared threading=multi`` —
##      drives the compile + install pass; emits all shipping shared
##      libraries + headers under ``$out/lib`` + ``$out/include``.
##   3. ``mkdir -p $out/install/usr && cp -a $out/lib $out/include
##      $out/install/usr/`` — moves the install tree under the canonical
##      ``install/usr`` prefix the stage-copy step expects.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables. The library filter is hardcoded to
## ``system,filesystem,thread,date_time,program_options`` — the exact set
## plasma-activities + the wider Plasma 6 surface consume. A future
## downstream variant can widen the filter to ``all`` for a fuller Boost
## install (at the cost of build time + disk usage).

  ##
  ## ``from-source-custom`` convention consumer: the anchor artifact's
  ## ``build:`` block records the bootstrap.sh + b2 + stage-copy shell
  ## sequence as verbatim shell actions. ``$extracted`` resolves to
  ## ``<projectRoot>/src/``; ``$out`` resolves to ``<projectRoot>/.repro/

  ## under ``$out/install/usr/`` carries all per-library .so files + the

    ## sibling ``from-source-{cmake,autotools,make,meson}`` conventions would
    ## otherwise mis-route). Boost's bootstrap.sh + b2 toolchain is fully
    ## self-contained on plain gcc; the internal sub-builds that invoke
    ## ``make`` (a handful of auxiliary code-gen sub-steps) get a system
    ## ``make`` from the host PATH, which is acceptable for the build.
