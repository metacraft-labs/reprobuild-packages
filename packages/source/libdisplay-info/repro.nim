## Source-from-tarball libdisplay-info recipe — M9.R.59.2 (second of
## two recipes closing the wlroots DRM-backend compile-time gate
## residual from M9.R.58).
##
## libdisplay-info is Simon Ser's C library for parsing EDID
## (Extended Display Identification Data — the byte blob a monitor
## reports over I2C/DDC / DisplayPort AUX) and DisplayID (the modern
## VESA replacement for EDID). It's a small (~4 KLOC) MIT-licensed
## meson-built library that ships one .so + a headers set + a
## debugging CLI (``di-edid-decode``).
##
## ## Why libdisplay-info matters for the NDE-H Sway DRM-backend story
##
## wlroots 0.19's DRM backend meson probe at
## ``wlroots-0.19.3/backend/drm/meson.build:8-13`` declares
## ``libdisplay_info = dependency('libdisplay-info', required: 'drm'
## in backends, fallback: 'libdisplay-info')`` and immediately below,
## the DRM subdir gate at line 22 reads
## ``if not (hwdata.found() and libdisplay_info.found() and
## features['session']) { subdir_done() }``. wlroots' DRM backend
## consumes libdisplay-info to parse EDID payloads from connected
## displays; without it, the backend is compiled out entirely.
##
## Along with M9.R.59.1's hwdata recipe, this closes the last two
## upstream deps of wlroots' DRM backend, moving wlroots' meson-log
## line ``drm-backend : NO`` to ``drm-backend : YES``.
##
## ## Upstream project — libdisplay-info (single-repo, C library)
##
## Simon Ser's ``libdisplay-info`` upstream at
## ``https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/emersion/libdisplay-info`` is the
## canonical home. nixpkgs pins
## ``pkgs/development/libraries/libdisplay-info`` against the same
## upstream tags. The library is developed alongside wlroots (Simon
## Ser is a wlroots maintainer), so version coordination between the
## two is tight.
##
## ## Version choice — 0.2.0 (matches wlroots 0.19 upstream test matrix)
##
## Upstream ships two active release lines: 0.2.0 (April 2024, MAJOR
## symbol addition for the CTA-861 codec-3D parsing) and 0.3.0
## (October 2024, ergonomics/API-cleanup). wlroots 0.19 was written
## against 0.2.0 (per the wlroots 0.19 release notes) and does not
## use any 0.3.x-only symbols. Pinning 0.2.0 gives a byte-for-byte
## match with what upstream wlroots 0.19 was tested against.
##
## sha256 = 5a2f002a16f42dd3540c8846f80a90b8f4bdcd067a94b9d2087bc2feae974176
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``libdisplay-info-0.2.0.tar.xz``,
##  95,280 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_meson convention (M9.K) reads the ``fetch:`` block and
## the inline mesonOptions (via the M9.R.5b explicit ``build:``
## block) and lowers them into fetch + configure + compile + install
## BuildActions. libdisplay-info's meson build is minimal —
## meson.build has no explicit options; it auto-detects hwdata via
## ``dependency('hwdata', required: false, native: true)`` and
## consumes ``hwdata_dir/pnp.ids`` at build time via a Python
## ``gen-search-table.py`` custom_target to synthesize the
## ``pnp-id-table.c`` PnP-vendor lookup file.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## libdisplay-info's meson build emits:
##
##   * ``libdisplay-info.so`` — the shared library wlroots links
##                              against (registered as
##                              ``libdisplayInfo`` in this recipe;
##                              the M9.L install glue resolves it to
##                              ``$prefix/lib/libdisplay-info.so*``).
##   * headers under ``include/libdisplay-info/`` — public API for
##                              consumers.
##   * ``libdisplay-info.pc`` — pkg-config metadata.
##   * ``di-edid-decode`` — CLI debugging tool that dumps parsed
##                          EDID/DisplayID as human-readable text.
##                          (Registered as ``diEdidDecode``; not
##                          consumed by wlroots but shipped alongside
##                          the library per the upstream convention.)
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — libdisplay-info's meson project
## exposes no options file (``meson_options.txt`` doesn't exist), so
## there's nothing to knob. The build always emits the library +
## di-edid-decode + tests; the tests are skipped at meson-setup time
## when the test-runtime dep (edid-decode) isn't on PATH.
##
## The ``--buildtype=release`` flag is the constructor's default
## (matches the sibling from-source recipes).
