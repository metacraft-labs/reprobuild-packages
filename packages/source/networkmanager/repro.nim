## Source-from-tarball NetworkManager recipe — the SEVENTIETH real
## from-source production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio.
## NetworkManager is THE canonical network configuration daemon on
## modern Linux desktops: every NDE-K1 v1 desktop (sway / GNOME /
## Plasma) consumes its D-Bus API for Wi-Fi connection management,
## Ethernet hot-plug response, VPN routing, and the per-application
## network-status indicators.
##
## NetworkManager joins ``alsaLibSource`` + ``pipewireSource`` +
## ``wireplumberSource`` in the network + audio infrastructure batch
## adding the four runtime daemons + libraries every modern desktop
## (sway / GNOME / Plasma) consumes.
##
## ## Why NetworkManager matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## NetworkManager owns the desktop network plane end-to-end:
##
##   * **Wi-Fi connection management**: NetworkManager's wifi plugin
##     drives wpa_supplicant for WPA2/WPA3 authentication and stores
##     per-SSID connection profiles under
##     ``/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/``. GNOME's
##     gnome-control-center Wi-Fi panel, Plasma's
##     plasma-nm widget, and sway's nm-applet all consume this surface.
##   * **Ethernet hot-plug**: NetworkManager listens to udev
##     netlink events and brings up DHCP / static-IP configurations
##     when a wired link goes up. The ``NetworkManager-wait-online``
##     companion unit blocks the systemd default.target until
##     connectivity is established.
##   * **VPN integration**: NetworkManager's plugin architecture
##     supports OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPsec/IKEv2, and PPTP via
##     ``NetworkManager-<vpn>`` plugin packages. The
##     gnome-control-center Network panel and Plasma's network
##     widget surface these as first-class connection types.
##   * **Network-status indicators**: every desktop's status bar
##     widget (sway's waybar network module, GNOME shell's top-bar
##     network indicator, Plasma's system tray icon) consumes the
##     NetworkManager D-Bus interface
##     ``org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device.State`` for the
##     connection-state icon updates.
##   * **DNS resolution coordination**: NetworkManager writes
##     ``/etc/resolv.conf`` based on per-connection DNS settings,
##     coordinating with systemd-resolved when present or owning the
##     file directly when not. NDE-K1 v1 disables systemd-resolved so
##     NetworkManager owns resolv.conf directly.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## Per the network + audio batch convention (matching the kernel +
## recent-batch precedent), we point the live ``fetch:`` URL at upstream
## directly (no vendoring), and pin the sha256 over the upstream tarball
## bytes. The hash is cross-checked against the nixpkgs
## ``networkmanager`` recipe at
## ``pkgs/by-name/ne/networkmanager/package.nix`` which fetches the
## same upstream archive via ``fetchurl``.
##
## ## Version choice — 1.56.0 (current upstream stable)
##
## NetworkManager releases are cut on gitlab.freedesktop.org under
## ``releases/<X>.<Y>.<Z>``. The 1.56.0 release is the current stable
## as of mid-2026 (matches the nixpkgs pin). NetworkManager moved its
## release-tarball hosting from download.gnome.org (the historical
## home pre-2022) to gitlab.freedesktop.org/.../releases/.../downloads/
## after the freedesktop migration; the task brief's pointer to
## download.gnome.org reflects the legacy URL form. The libnm-1 ABI
## has been stable since 1.0; any ``>=1.30`` covers the modern
## sway / GNOME / Plasma desktop story.
##
## sha256 = 59a32d385cc1e7ae26e43798c6f12d07ff6198abd041ec0620b3a08cfc021ccc
##  (cross-checked against nixpkgs's SRI-form
##  ``sha256-WaMtOFzB564m5DeYxvEtB/9hmKvQQewGILOgjPwCHMw=`` at
##  ``pkgs/by-name/ne/networkmanager/package.nix``, which decodes to
##  the same hex over the same upstream tarball bytes).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## NetworkManager 1.56 builds with Meson. The c_cpp_meson convention
## reads the M9.H ``fetch:`` block and the inlined Meson options and
## lowers them into fetch + setup + compile + install BuildActions;
## the per-artifact build body + install glue records the
## executable + executable + library artifacts via the two
## ``executable`` + one ``library`` blocks so the artifact
## registry already knows what binaries + shared object to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## NetworkManager's Meson build emits a vast set of binaries +
## libraries + per-device plugins + nss modules; we register the
## three load-bearing ones for the v1 desktop story:
##
##   * ``nmDaemon`` — ``/usr/sbin/NetworkManager``, the connection
##                    manager daemon. Started by
##                    ``NetworkManager.service`` (system systemd
##                    unit) on every boot, owns the connection
##                    state-machine + the D-Bus name
##                    ``org.freedesktop.NetworkManager``.
##   * ``nmcli``    — ``/usr/bin/nmcli``, the connection-management
##                    CLI used by ops + by the user-session activation
##                    layer to bring up specific connection profiles
##                    declaratively. NDE-K1 v1 manifest activations
##                    shell out to nmcli for connection-profile
##                    install.
##   * ``libNm``    — ``libnm.so``, the C library every desktop
##                    network widget (sway's waybar network module,
##                    GNOME shell's top-bar network indicator,
##                    Plasma's system tray icon) links against to
##                    consume the NetworkManager D-Bus interface
##                    via the high-level ``NMClient`` /
##                    ``NMDevice`` /``NMActiveConnection`` GObject
##                    types.
##
## The bare-``NetworkManager`` upstream binary name is renamed to
## ``nmDaemon`` to (1) avoid identifier collision with the package
## name's ``networkmanager`` prefix and (2) follow the
## systemdInit / sddmGreeter convention of disambiguating
## package-level daemon binaries from short package names. The
## SONAME ``libnm`` is camelCased to ``libNm`` per the libAsound /
## libExpat / libGlib2 precedent of preserving the canonical
## ``lib`` prefix while PascalCasing the SONAME body.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the Meson options are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * tests, docs, manpages, introspection, Vala, Qt, NMTUI, PPP,
##     ModemManager, OVS, cloud setup, SELinux, audit, and connectivity
##     checking are disabled to keep the initial daemon closure focused.
##   * systemd session tracking, udev discovery, Wi-Fi, the internal
##     DHCP client, D-Bus, and polkit remain enabled for desktop use.
##   * GnuTLS is selected instead of the default NSS crypto backend so
##     the package consumes the sibling source-built TLS stack.
