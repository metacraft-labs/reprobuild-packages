## Source-from-tarball procps recipe — the FORTY-EIGHTH real
## from-source production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio.
## procps is the canonical Linux process-utilities userland — every
## ``ps`` / ``top`` / ``free`` / ``kill`` / ``uptime`` call on every
## modern Linux distribution flows through the libproc2 ABI this
## recipe lifts.
##
## ## Why procps matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## procps (upstream branded as ``procps-ng``) is the GNU/Linux process-
## utilities suite. The binaries this recipe registers are the load-
## bearing surface every shell session, every monitoring agent, and
## every sysadmin diagnostic playbook depends on:
##
##   * ``ps`` is the canonical process-state CLI; every shell session
##     uses it (``ps aux | grep ...``), every monitoring agent shells
##     into it to gather process-state snapshots, and every container-
##     runtime debug path enumerates PIDs through it.
##   * ``top`` is the interactive process-monitor TUI; sysadmins run
##     it on first contact with a hot box.
##   * ``free`` is the memory-summary CLI consumed by every "is the
##     box swapping" diagnostic.
##   * ``kill`` is the signal-delivery CLI consumed by every shutdown
##     script + every supervisor (s6 / runit / systemd-when-not-using-
##     systemctl) at termination time.
##   * ``uptime`` is the load-average CLI consumed by every health-
##     check script.
##
## ``libproc2.so`` is the C library every modern monitoring tool
## (``htop``, ``glances``, ``btop``) links against rather than parsing
## ``/proc/<pid>/`` directly.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream v4.0.5 GitLab archive .tar.gz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/procps/vendor/procps-v4.0.5.tar.gz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The gitlab.com archive URL is
## recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 4.0.5 (current upstream stable)
##
## procps-ng releases are cut on gitlab.com under tags of the form
## ``v<X>.<Y>.<Z>``. 4.0.5 is the current stable in the 4.x line as of
## mid-2026 and the libproc2 ABI has been stable since the 4.0 cut
## (the 3.x -> 4.x bump renamed ``libprocps.so`` to ``libproc2.so`` and
## reshaped the API; anything ``>=4.0`` covers the htop + glances + btop
## consumption).
##
## sha256 = 2c6d7ed9f2acde1d4dd4602c6172fe56eff86953fe8639bd633dbd22cc18f5db
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``procps-v4.0.5.tar.gz``,
##  2,392,641 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape — custom autoreconf
##
## procps's GitLab archive ships ``configure.ac`` but NO pre-generated
## ``configure`` script (unlike the kernel.org release tarballs that
## pre-generate it). The c_cpp_autotools convention's lowering runs
## ``autoreconf -fi`` (via the ``autoconf`` tool dependency declared in
## ``uses:``) before invoking ``./configure``. The ``--disable-nls``
## flag elides the gettext dependency surface that the
## ``autoreconf`` pass would otherwise activate.
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into fetch + ``autoreconf`` +
## ``./configure`` + ``make`` BuildActions; the per-artifact build body
## + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe records the six artifacts
## via the ``library`` + ``executable`` blocks so the M9.K artifact
## registry already knows what shared object + binaries to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## procps's autotools build emits six load-bearing outputs from a
## single ``./configure`` + ``make`` invocation:
##
##   * ``ps``       — ``/bin/ps`` the process-state CLI.
##   * ``top``      — ``/usr/bin/top`` the interactive process-monitor.
##   * ``free``     — ``/usr/bin/free`` the memory-summary CLI.
##   * ``kill``     — ``/bin/kill`` the signal-delivery CLI.
##   * ``uptime``   — ``/usr/bin/uptime`` the load-average CLI.
##   * ``libProc2`` — ``libproc2.so`` the process-introspection C
##                    library consumed by htop + glances + btop.
##
## The upstream SONAME ``proc2`` is represented as ``libProc2`` so the
## task brief (matches the libCap / libExpat / libGlib2 precedent of
## preserving the canonical ``lib`` prefix while PascalCasing the
## SONAME body, with the ``2`` version-suffix folded into the
## convention layer's lib-versioning metadata). The binary names
## (``ps``, ``top``, ``free``, ``kill``, ``uptime``) are already
## unambiguous and used bare.
##
## NOTE: ``kill`` here is the procps-ng ``kill`` not the util-linux
## ``kill``; coreutils's ``--enable-no-install-program=kill`` flag
## (forty-third recipe) defers to this binary at install time, so the
## two recipes do not produce conflicting artifacts at the desktop's
## ``/usr/bin/kill`` slot.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--disable-static``   — skip the static archive (not used by
##                               the v1 desktop story; libs are
##                               dynamic).
##   * ``--disable-nls``      — skip the native-language-support
##                               gettext dependency surface (heavy
##                               .mo/.po pipeline, not needed for the
##                               v1 desktop's English-locale default).
##   * ``--with-systemd=no``  — skip the libsystemd dependency at
##                               configure time; procps is a systemd
##                               dependency in the other direction
##                               (systemctl shells into ``ps`` for
##                               unit-state probes). Avoids a cyclic
##                               uses graph between systemd + procps.

package procpsSource:
  ## From-source procps-ng — forty-eighth M9.H/I/K production recipe.
  ## The canonical Linux process-utilities userland: ``ps`` + ``top`` +
  ## ``free`` + ``kill`` + ``uptime`` + ``libproc2.so`` all built from
  ## one autotools ``./configure`` + ``make`` invocation. FIRST recipe
  ## in the corpus to consume the GitLab archive endpoint
  ## (``/-/archive/<tag>/<name>-<tag>.tar.gz``); the prior forty-seven
  ## from-source recipes used kernel.org / freedesktop / GitHub / GNOME
  ## / KDE / freedesktop endpoints.
  ##
  ## Tier-2b c_cpp_autotools convention consumer: the convention layer
  ## reads the ``fetch:`` block (registered via ``registeredFetchSpec``)
  ## and the ``configureFlags:`` block (registered via
  ## ``registeredBuildFlags`` on the ``"configure"`` channel) and
  ## lowers them into fetch + autoreconf + configure BuildActions wired
  ## with the right URL + hash + flags. Five executable + one library
  ## artifact recipe.
