## Smoke test for the from-source ``kernelSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the SIXTH real production
## from-source recipe (predecessors: ``dbusBrokerSource`` /
## ``libdrmSource`` / ``waylandSource`` / ``wlrootsSource`` /
## ``swaySource``). The kernel's specific coverage angle is that it
## is the FIRST consumer of the M9.I ``makeFlags:`` channel — the
## five prior from-source recipes all build under meson + ninja and
## consume ``mesonOptions:``. The kernel by contrast drives ``make``
## /kbuild, so this recipe's M9.I round-trip exercises the
## ``"make"`` channel of ``registeredBuildFlags``, complementing the
## five prior recipes' ``"meson"`` coverage.
##
## The recipe also exercises a MIXED artifact set: ONE
## ``executable`` (bzImage — the bootable kernel image) plus THREE
## ``files`` artifacts (vmlinux + System.map + KERNELRELEASE). The
## prior recipes covered: dbus-broker = 2 executables, libdrm = 3
## libraries, Wayland = 3 libs + 1 exec, wlroots = 1 library,
## Sway = 4 executables. The kernel is the first to combine 1
## ``dakExecutable`` with 3 ``dakFiles`` in a single recipe, so the
## M3 artifact registry's exec-vs-files discriminator gets a fresh
## angle of coverage.
##
## Coverage:
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``makeFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-
##     isolation spot-check (the ``meson`` channel must NOT see
##     the make flags).
##   * MIXED artifact registration (M3) — ``bzImage`` registered as
##     ``dakExecutable``; ``vmlinux`` / ``systemMap`` /
##     ``kernelRelease`` registered as ``dakFiles``. All four
##     attributed to ``kernelSource``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
