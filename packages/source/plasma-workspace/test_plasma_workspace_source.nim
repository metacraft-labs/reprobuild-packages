## Smoke test for the from-source ``plasmaWorkspaceSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the TWENTY-FIRST real
## production from-source recipe and the THIRD recipe in the Plasma
## stack batch. plasma-workspace's unique coverage angle vs the prior
## twenty is that it's the FIRST CMake recipe to combine BOTH a
## multi-word-kebab package name (``plasma-workspace`` ->
## ``plasmaWorkspaceSource``) AND a mixed-kind artifact set
## (library + executable). The gnome-shell precedent exercised the
## same multi-word-kebab + mixed-kind shape on the meson channel;
## this is the CMake-side analogue, so a regression that fumbled the
## multi-word kebab-to-camel translation specifically on the CMake
## channel would surface here.
##
## Coverage (12 check assertions across 8 tests):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``cmakeFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + configure channels MUST be empty).
##   * Library + executable artifact registration (M3) —
##     ``libkworkspace6`` tagged ``dakLibrary`` and ``plasmashell``
##     tagged ``dakExecutable`` within the same package's artifact set.
##     (M9.R.36.2 verified the upstream CMake target installs
##     ``libkworkspace6.so`` via an explicit ``OUTPUT_NAME kworkspace6``;
##     the speculative ``libPlasmaWorkspace`` name never existed in the
##     install-mirror.)
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
