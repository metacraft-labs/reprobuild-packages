## Source-from-tarball plasma-workspace recipe — the TWENTY-FIRST real
## from-source production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio and the
## THIRD recipe in the Plasma stack batch (kcoreaddons / kwin /
## plasma-workspace / sddm).
##
## Prior twenty from-source recipes — fourteen meson, one make, three
## CMake (json-c, kcoreaddons, kwin), two autotools (expat, gdm) —
## collectively covered every M9.I flag-injection channel and every
## artifact-kind permutation. plasma-workspace is the FOURTH CMake-
## driven recipe and the FIRST CMake recipe to combine BOTH a
## multi-word-kebab package name (``plasma-workspace`` ->
## ``plasmaWorkspace``) AND a mixed-kind artifact set (library +
## executable). The gnome-shell precedent exercised the same shape on
## the meson channel; this is the CMake-side analogue, so a regression
## that fumbled the multi-word kebab-to-camel translation specifically
## on the CMake channel would surface here.
##
## ## Why plasma-workspace matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## plasma-workspace is the KDE Plasma user-session UI — the analogue
## of gnome-shell for the Plasma story. The standalone ``plasmashell``
## binary is the user-session leader: it owns the task bar, system
## tray, application launcher, activities, lock screen, and global
## notifications. ``libkworkspace6.so`` (M9.R.36.2 — was speculatively
## named ``libPlasmaWorkspace.so`` in the recipe pre-M9.R.36) is the
## Plasma workspace library third-party Plasma widgets + applets link
## against to register UI contributions. NDE-K1's
## ``startplasma-wayland`` chain-execs into ``plasmashell`` after kwin
## hands off the Wayland compositor. The from-source recipe lifts the
## NDE-K1 apt-jammy plasma-workspace .deb pin to a real
## ``plasmashell`` binary + ``libkworkspace6.so`` library artifact
## for the v2 Plasma story.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 6.2.5 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/plasma-workspace/vendor/plasma-workspace-6.2.5.tar.xz``
## and reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The download.kde.org release
## URL is recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 6.2.5 (matches the sibling kwin pin)
##
## download.kde.org publishes KDE Plasma releases at
## ``https://download.kde.org/stable/plasma/<x.y.z>/``. plasma-workspace
## 6.2.5 is the current stable matching the sibling ``kwin``
## 6.2.5 pin (the Plasma 6.x point releases ship as a coordinated set
## so plasma-workspace + kwin minor lines MUST stay in lockstep).
##
## sha256 = b82511e46f62e1b8f60b969c828c8d8d32fc7928401a70cc28c29f85f46c412f
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``plasma-workspace-6.2.5.tar.xz``,
##  19,136,676 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_cmake convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``cmakeFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``cmake`` configure BuildAction that depends on the fetch
##      action and passes every flag in ``cmakeFlags:`` to
##      ``cmake -S <src> -B <build>``, in declared order.
##   3. a ``ninja`` (or ``cmake --build``) compile BuildAction (M9.L).
##   4. install/output collection actions for the library + executable
##      artifacts (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ninja-spawn + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records the artifacts via one ``library`` block + one
## ``executable`` block so the M9.K artifact registry already knows
## what shared object + binary to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## plasma-workspace's CMake build emits one shared library + one
## standalone binary (among many others — we only register the v1
## artifacts the NDE-K1 desktop entry depends on):
##
##   * ``libkworkspace6.so`` — the Plasma workspace library third-
##                              party Plasma widgets + applets link
##                              against to register UI contributions.
##                              Upstream CMake target name is
##                              ``KWorkspace`` with explicit
##                              ``OUTPUT_NAME kworkspace6`` (so the
##                              ``6`` is the KF6 major-version ABI
##                              suffix, NOT the package name).
##                              M9.R.36.2 fixed the recipe's
##                              previously-speculative
##                              ``libPlasmaWorkspace`` declaration.
##   * ``plasmashell`` — the standalone shell binary that drives the
##                       Plasma user-session UI (task bar, system
##                       tray, application launcher, activities, lock
##                       screen, notifications). NDE-K1's
##                       ``startplasma-wayland`` chain-execs into
##                       this after kwin hands off the Wayland
##                       compositor.
##
## We register the library under the package-level identifier
## ``libkworkspace6`` (the upstream CMake ``OUTPUT_NAME`` for the
## ``KWorkspace`` target — kebab-passes-through verbatim, single
## lowercase word + KF6 ABI suffix), and the executable under
## ``plasmashell`` (kept verbatim — the upstream binary name is
## already a single lowercase word, no kebab segments to camelCase).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the CMake options are hardcoded to the
## modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``BUILD_TESTING=OFF``  — skip the upstream test suite to keep
##                                the build hermetic + fast.
##   * ``KWIN_BUILD_X11=OFF`` — skip the X11/XWayland session support
##                                (the v1 Plasma story is pure-Wayland;
##                                the NDE-K1 spec pins only
##                                ``plasma.desktop``, not
##                                ``plasmax11.desktop``). The flag
##                                propagates through plasma-workspace's
##                                kwin-integration sub-build to keep
##                                this recipe in lockstep with the
##                                sibling ``kwin`` recipe's
##                                identical ``-DKWIN_BUILD_X11=OFF``.
##   * ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`` — release-mode optimisation;
##                                     matches the sibling from-source
##                                     recipes' ``--buildtype=release``
##                                     meson option.
##
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. an X11-supporting variant
## that flips ``KWIN_BUILD_X11=ON`` for legacy bundles).

        # integer; the ABI is byte-identical to ``std::uint32_t`` on
        # every supported platform, so the substitution is a pure
