## Smoke test for the from-source ``libcapSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the THIRTY-FOURTH real
## production from-source recipe. libcap's unique coverage angle vs
## the prior thirty-three is the M9.I ``makeFlags:`` channel feeding
## a RAW Makefile (no ``./configure`` step) — only the SECOND recipe
## in the corpus to consume ``makeFlags:`` (linux-kernel was the
## first), and the FIRST recipe to drive a non-kbuild raw Makefile
## through the channel. The cross-channel isolation pin below would
## surface a regression that mis-routes a libcap ``BUILD_CC=`` /
## ``prefix=`` makefile variable onto the configure / meson / cmake
## channels (autotools / cmake / meson have different flag grammars
## and a misroute would fail the build).
##
## Additionally, libcap is the FIRST recipe in the corpus to ship a
## ONE-library + THREE-executable mixed-kind shape from a raw
## Makefile package (the kernel ships one-exec + three-files; libcap
## inverts to one-lib + three-exec).
##
## Coverage (≥8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``makeFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order sequence
##     equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (configure + meson + cmake channels MUST be empty).
##   * FOUR artifact registration (M3) — ``libCap`` tagged
##     ``dakLibrary`` + ``capsh`` + ``getcap`` + ``setcap`` tagged
##     ``dakExecutable``, all in the same package's artifact set.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
