## Source-from-tarball libcap recipe — the THIRTY-FOURTH real
## from-source production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio.
## libcap's unique coverage angle vs the prior thirty-three recipes
## is the M9.I ``makeFlags:`` channel feeding a RAW Makefile (no
## ``./configure`` step) — only the SECOND recipe in the corpus to
## consume ``makeFlags:`` (linux-kernel was the first), and the FIRST
## recipe to drive a non-kbuild raw Makefile through the channel. This
## pins the ``makeFlags:`` channel's grammar from a second flavour:
## kbuild variable-overrides (linux-kernel: ``ARCH=`` + ``LOCALVERSION=``
## + ``-j1``) plus libcap-style ``BUILD_CC=`` + ``prefix=`` overrides.
##
## ## Why libcap matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## libcap is the canonical POSIX capabilities library every Linux
## daemon links to drop-and-keep capabilities at startup:
##
##   * systemd's per-unit ``CapabilityBoundingSet=`` directive uses
##     libcap to compute the bounding set bitmap.
##   * sshd's privilege-separation child uses libcap to drop all
##     capabilities after fork.
##   * NetworkManager uses libcap to keep CAP_NET_ADMIN after dropping
##     the rest.
##   * Plasma's ``kwin_wayland`` uses libcap to keep CAP_SYS_NICE for
##     real-time scheduling.
##
## ``capsh`` is the canonical capability-shell debugger admin teams
## use to inspect capability sets; ``getcap`` / ``setcap`` are the
## file-capability CLIs that pin per-binary CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE etc
## without making the binary suid-root.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream v2.71 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/libcap/vendor/libcap-2.71.tar.xz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The kernel.org release URL is
## recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 2.71 (current upstream stable)
##
## libcap releases are cut on kernel.org under the libcap2 series;
## 2.71 is the current stable as of mid-2026 and the ABI has been
## stable since 2.60 — anything ``>=2.60`` covers the systemd / sshd /
## NetworkManager consumption.
##
## sha256 = b7006c9af5168315f35fc734bf1a8d2aa70766bd8b8c4340962e05b19c35b900
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``libcap-2.71.tar.xz``,
##  193,512 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## libcap uses a RAW Makefile (no ``./configure`` step). The
## c_cpp_make convention (M9.K's sibling lowering) reads both the
## M9.H ``fetch:`` block and the M9.I ``makeFlags:`` block off this
## package's registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``make`` compile BuildAction that depends on the fetch
##      action and passes every flag in ``makeFlags:`` to ``make``,
##      in declared order.
##   3. install/output collection actions for the four artifacts
##      (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ``make`` + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records the four artifacts via the ``library`` + ``executable``
## blocks so the M9.K artifact registry already knows what shared
## object + binaries to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## libcap's build emits four load-bearing outputs from a single
## ``make`` invocation against the raw Makefile:
##
##   * ``libCap``  — ``libcap.so`` the POSIX capabilities library
##                    consumed by systemd / sshd / NetworkManager /
##                    kwin_wayland.
##   * ``capsh``   — ``/sbin/capsh`` the capability-shell debugger
##                    admin teams use to inspect capability sets.
##   * ``getcap``  — ``/sbin/getcap`` the file-capability inspector.
##   * ``setcap``  — ``/sbin/setcap`` the file-capability mutator
##                    that pins per-binary CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE etc
##                    without making the binary suid-root.
##
## We register the artifacts under the package-level identifiers
## ``libCap`` (PascalCased from upstream SONAME ``cap`` per the
## libExpat / libZ / libGlib2 precedent) and the bare upstream binary
## names ``capsh`` / ``getcap`` / ``setcap`` (no rename needed —
## these are unambiguous and already lowercase).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the make flags are hardcoded to the
## modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``BUILD_CC=gcc``      — pin the host compiler used at build
##                              time (vs the cross compiler for
##                              target binaries). libcap's Makefile
##                              defaults to ``cc`` which is brittle
##                              on systems without a /usr/bin/cc
##                              symlink.
##   * ``RAISE_SETFCAP=no``  — skip the post-install ``setcap``
##                              invocation on ``setcap`` itself; the
##                              v1 desktop's install layer runs as
##                              the build user, not root, and cannot
##                              raise file capabilities.
##   * ``lib=lib``           — pin the library install subdir name to
##                              ``lib`` (vs ``lib64`` which libcap's
##                              Makefile picks on x86_64 by default).
##                              The v1 desktop uses ``/lib`` not
##                              ``/lib64`` per the FHS-3 merged-/usr
##                              layout.
##   * ``prefix=/usr``       — pin the install prefix to ``/usr``
##                              (vs the libcap default of ``/usr``
##                              which is fine but we pin it
##                              explicitly so the cache key is
##                              stable across a future Makefile
##                              default change).
##   * ``GOLANG=no``         — skip the Go bindings build (heavy Go
##                              toolchain dependency surface, not
##                              needed at runtime).
##
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. a Go-edition variant that
## flips ``GOLANG=yes`` for the Go-based admin tooling, or a
## ``/lib64`` variant for distros following the SysV
## bi-arch convention).
