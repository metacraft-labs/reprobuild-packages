## Smoke test for the from-source ``qt6BaseSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the TWENTY-SIXTH real
## production from-source recipe and the SIXTH CMake-driven recipe
## (json-c, kcoreaddons, kwin, plasma-workspace, sddm precedents).
## qt6-base's unique coverage angle vs the prior twenty-five recipes
## is that it's the FIRST recipe to ship SIX library artifacts from a
## single ``package`` macro — every prior multi-artifact recipe shipped
## two (wayland's libs, pango, mutter / gnome-shell / kwin /
## plasma-workspace / gdm pairs), three (sddm) or four (glib2). The
## six-artifact cardinality stresses the M3 registry's ability to keep
## six distinct ``dakLibrary`` entries disambiguated within a single
## package's artifact set.
##
## qt6-base is ALSO the LARGEST vendored recipe in the corpus by far
## (48.2 MB compressed vs the second-largest plasma-workspace at
## 19.1 MB and the prior champion kwin at 8.6 MB). The vendor-vs-
## upstream-URL choice is documented in the recipe comment block: we
## vendor because 48 MB sits well below the kernel-precedent 90 MB
## cutoff for the upstream-URL fallback.
##
## Coverage (16 check assertions across 9 tests):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``cmakeFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + configure channels MUST be empty).
##   * SIX library artifact registration (M3) — ``libQt6Core``,
##     ``libQt6Gui``, ``libQt6Widgets``, ``libQt6Network``,
##     ``libQt6DBus``, ``libQt6Sql`` all tagged ``dakLibrary``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
