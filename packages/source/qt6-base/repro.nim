## Source-from-tarball qt6-base recipe — the TWENTY-SIXTH real from-
## source production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio
## (fetch: + cmakeFlags: + convention-layer fetch-action emission).
##
## Prior twenty-five from-source recipes — sixteen meson (dbus-broker,
## libdrm, wayland, wlroots, sway, libxkbcommon, pixman, libinput, cairo,
## pango, gdk-pixbuf, glib2, mutter, gnome-shell, harfbuzz this batch),
## one make (linux-kernel), five CMake (json-c, kcoreaddons, kwin,
## plasma-workspace, sddm), four autotools (expat, gdm, freetype this
## batch, fontconfig this batch) — collectively covered every M9.I
## flag-injection channel. qt6-base is the SIXTH CMake-driven recipe
## and the FIRST recipe in the corpus to ship SIX library artifacts
## from a single ``package`` macro. Every prior multi-artifact recipe
## shipped either two (most multi-artifact recipes) or three (sddm) or
## four (glib2); qt6-base pushes the artifact-name partitioning to six,
## stressing the M3 registry's ability to keep six distinct
## ``dakLibrary`` entries disambiguated within a single package's
## artifact set.
##
## ## Why qt6-base matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## qt6-base is the bottom of the Qt6 dependency graph: QtCore (event
## loop, signals/slots, containers, JSON), QtGui (windowing system
## abstraction, painting, accessibility), QtWidgets (the desktop widget
## set used by Plasma System Settings + KCMs), QtNetwork (HTTP/TCP
## client+server, SSL), QtDBus (D-Bus binding used by Plasma's
## inter-service plumbing), QtSql (DB driver framework used by
## KConfigData + Plasma activities). Every KF6 module + every Plasma
## component links against qt6-base; the sibling ``kcoreaddonsSource``
## and ``kwinSource`` recipes pin ``qt6-base >=6.6`` in their ``uses:``
## blocks. The mutter + gnome-shell stack also picks up qt6-base
## transitively via the SDDM greeter QML runtime.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream qtbase-everywhere-src-6.8.1 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/qt6-base/vendor/qtbase-everywhere-src-6.8.1.tar.xz``
## and reference it via a ``file://`` URL. At 48,220,752 bytes the
## tarball is well under GitHub's 100-MB single-file ceiling so
## vendoring is safe (kernel-style upstream-URL fallback would only be
## warranted above ~90 MB). The download.qt.io release URL is recorded
## as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for documentation and
## future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:`` block points at the
## vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted fetch action is
## offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 6.8.1 (current upstream LTS-leading)
##
## download.qt.io publishes Qt6 modular submodule sources at
## ``https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/<major.minor>/<version>/submodules/``
## and 6.8.1 is the current stable in the 6.8.x line as of mid-2026.
## The 6.x ABI compatibility is maintained across 6.6 -> 6.7 -> 6.8 so
## the ``qt6-base >=6.6`` floor in the KF6 / kwin / kcoreaddons recipes
## is fully satisfied by 6.8.1.
##
## sha256 = 40b14562ef3bd779bc0e0418ea2ae08fa28235f8ea6e8c0cb3bce1d6ad58dcaf
##  (computed locally over the vendored
##  ``qtbase-everywhere-src-6.8.1.tar.xz``, 48,220,752 bytes; downloaded
##  once from the upstream URL recorded in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_cmake convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``cmakeFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``cmake`` configure BuildAction that depends on the fetch
##      action and passes every flag in ``cmakeFlags:`` to
##      ``cmake -S <src> -B <build>``, in declared order.
##   3. a ``ninja`` (or ``cmake --build``) compile BuildAction (M9.L).
##   4. install/output collection actions for the six library artifacts
##      (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ninja-spawn + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records all six library artifacts via the ``library`` blocks so the
## M9.K artifact registry already knows what shared objects to expect.
##
## ## Library artifacts
##
## qt6-base's CMake build emits six load-bearing shared libraries that
## the v1 desktop story consumes:
##
##   * ``libQt6Core.so``    — the event loop + signals/slots + container
##                             foundation every Qt-using app links.
##   * ``libQt6Gui.so``     — the windowing system abstraction + painting
##                             + accessibility layer.
##   * ``libQt6Widgets.so`` — the desktop widget set used by Plasma
##                             System Settings + KCM modules.
##   * ``libQt6Network.so`` — the HTTP/TCP client+server + SSL stack
##                             used by Plasma + KIO.
##   * ``libQt6DBus.so``    — the D-Bus binding used by Plasma's
##                             inter-service plumbing + KNotifications.
##   * ``libQt6Sql.so``     — the DB driver framework used by
##                             KConfigData + Plasma activities (SQLite
##                             driver enabled via FEATURE_sql_sqlite).
##
## We register the artifacts under the package-level identifiers
## ``libQt6Core`` / ``libQt6Gui`` / ``libQt6Widgets`` / ``libQt6Network``
## / ``libQt6DBus`` / ``libQt6Sql`` (preserving the upstream PascalCase
## SONAME naming convention; matches the json-c / kcoreaddons precedent
## of preserving library-style PascalCase identifiers when the upstream
## SONAME is already PascalCase).
##
## We intentionally do NOT register the auxiliary
## ``libQt6OpenGL.so`` / ``libQt6PrintSupport.so`` / ``libQt6Test.so``
## / ``libQt6Concurrent.so`` / ``libQt6Xml.so`` — they're not on the
## v1 desktop critical path (Plasma uses QtQuick scene-graph which is
## in qt6-declarative, not qt6-base's QtOpenGL; printing isn't in v1;
## QtTest is build-time; QtConcurrent + QtXml are pulled in transitively
## via QtCore / QtGui).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the CMake options are hardcoded to the
## modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``BUILD_TESTING=OFF``          — skip the upstream test suite to
##                                       keep the build hermetic + fast.
##   * ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``   — release-mode optimisation;
##                                       matches the sibling from-source
##                                       recipes.
##   * ``FEATURE_developer_build=OFF`` — disable the upstream
##                                       developer-build mode which
##                                       enables extra debug helpers +
##                                       warnings-as-errors.
##   * ``FEATURE_xcb=OFF``            — drop X11/XCB support (the v1
##                                       desktop story is pure-Wayland;
##                                       Plasma + GNOME both ship
##                                       Wayland sessions only).
##   * ``FEATURE_dbus=ON``            — enable the D-Bus binding (used
##                                       by Plasma + KNotifications +
##                                       inter-service plumbing).
##   * ``FEATURE_sql_sqlite=ON``      — enable the SQLite SQL driver
##                                       (used by KConfigData + Plasma
##                                       activities).
##   * ``FEATURE_widgets=ON``         — enable the QtWidgets desktop
##                                       widget set (used by Plasma
##                                       System Settings + KCM modules).
##
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. an X11-supporting variant
## that flips ``FEATURE_xcb=ON`` for legacy bundles).
