## Source-from-tarball expat recipe — the FOURTEENTH real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio and the FIRST recipe
## to drive the ``configureFlags:`` channel (autotools-style
## ``./configure``).
##
## Prior thirteen from-source recipes — eleven meson (dbus-broker,
## libdrm, wayland, wlroots, sway, libxkbcommon, pixman, libinput,
## cairo, pango, gdk-pixbuf), one make (linux-kernel), one CMake
## (json-c) — collectively covered three of the five M9.I flag-injection
## channels (``mesonOptions:`` + ``makeFlags:`` + ``cmakeFlags:``).
## expat is the first autotools-driven upstream in the recipe suite,
## so it pins the M9.I per-channel isolation property from a third
## convention angle: a regression that misroutes a ``./configure``
## flag onto the meson or CMake channel would surface in the
## cross-channel-isolation pin in ``test_expat_source.nim``.
##
## ## Why expat matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## expat is a fast, stream-oriented C XML parser used as the canonical
## XML backend by a wide swath of desktop infrastructure: D-Bus's
## introspection XML parser, fontconfig's font-cache XML reader,
## shared-mime-info's MIME-database parser, and the GNOME accessibility
## stack's at-spi XML message decoder. It is a transitive dependency
## of every modern Linux desktop. The sibling ``dbusBrokerSource`` +
## ``fontconfig`` consumers pin ``expat >=2.6`` in their ``uses:``
## blocks (added when the desktop story closes), so this recipe is the
## upstream-source side of those dependency edges.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 2.7.0 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/expat/vendor/expat-2.7.0.tar.xz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The github.com release URL is
## recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's
## emitted fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 2.7.0 (current upstream stable)
##
## libexpat releases are cut on GitHub under tags of the form
## ``R_<major>_<minor>_<patch>``. The ``R_2_7_0`` tag is the current
## stable in the 2.7.x line as of mid-2026 and the ABI is stable
## since the 2.6 cut — anything ``>=2.6`` covers the dbus-broker +
## fontconfig + shared-mime-info consumption.
##
## sha256 = 25df13dd2819e85fb27a1ce0431772b7047d72af81ae78dc26b4c6e0805f48d1
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``expat-2.7.0.tar.xz``,
##  493,060 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H
## ``fetch:`` block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this
## package's registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``./configure`` BuildAction that depends on the fetch action
##      and passes every flag in ``configureFlags:`` to the upstream
##      configure script, in declared order.
##   3. a ``make`` compile BuildAction (M9.L).
##   4. install/output collection actions for the library artifact
##      (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ``make`` + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records the library artifact via the ``library`` block so the
## M9.K artifact registry already knows what shared object to expect.
##
## ## Library artifact
##
## expat's autotools build emits a single shared library
## (``libexpat.so``) bundling the SAX/expat parser core, the namespace
## parser, and the XML decoder helpers. We register the artifact under
## the package-level identifier ``libExpat`` (camelCased to follow
## the gdk-pixbuf / json-c precedent of camelCasing the package-level
## artifact identifier).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--disable-static``  — skip the static archive (not used by
##                              the v1 desktop story; cuts build time
##                              + cache size). Matches the
##                              ``BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=OFF`` json-c
##                              precedent.
##   * ``--without-docbook`` — skip the DocBook documentation build
##                              (heavy XSLT dependency surface, not
##                              needed at runtime).
##   * ``--without-examples`` — skip the bundled examples (XML pretty
##                               printer + element counter) that are
##                               not needed at runtime.
##   * ``--without-tests``   — skip the upstream test suite to keep
##                              the build hermetic + fast. Matches the
##                              ``BUILD_TESTING=OFF`` json-c precedent
##                              and the ``-Dtests=disabled`` cairo
##                              precedent.
##
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. a developer variant that
## flips ``--with-tests`` for CI bundles).
