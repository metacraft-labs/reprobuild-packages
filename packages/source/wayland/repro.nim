## Source-from-tarball Wayland recipe — the THIRD real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio
## (fetch: + mesonOptions: + convention-layer fetch-action emission).
##
## Follows the dbus-broker (executables) + libdrm (libraries) precedent:
## a meson/ninja build of upstream Wayland fed by a vendored tarball
## whose sha256 is pinned here for deterministic offline test
## reproduction. Wayland is the FIRST from-source recipe that produces
## BOTH library AND executable artifacts off the same build — the core
## protocol libraries (``libwayland-client``, ``libwayland-server``,
## ``libwayland-cursor``) plus the ``wayland-scanner`` code generator
## that wlroots / Sway / GNOME / Plasma all invoke at build time to
## emit protocol stubs.
##
## ## Why Wayland matters for the NDE-G/H/G1/K1 desktop stories
##
## ``recipes/packages/de-foundation/graphics-stack/repro.nim`` emits
## the user-facing graphics-stack config glue, and the three desktop
## environment recipes (Sway, GNOME, Plasma) all ship Wayland
## compositors that depend on Wayland's protocol library + scanner at
## build time. ``libwayland-client.so`` is linked by EVERY Wayland
## client (GTK, Qt, Firefox, ...). ``wayland-scanner`` is invoked at
## build time by every compositor to generate protocol marshalling
## stubs from XML protocol definitions. This recipe is the
## upstream-source side that all three DE recipes ultimately consume.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 1.25.0 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/wayland/vendor/wayland-1.25.0.tar.xz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The upstream gitlab releases
## URL is recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's
## emitted fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version drift vs the task brief
##
## The brief named 1.23.1; nixpkgs's
## ``pkgs/development/libraries/wayland/default.nix`` pins 1.25.0
## (SRI hash ``sha256-wGXwQK/f8xd2gGAPJJcn5Boa/CL8zyciLxX1MG+qHwM=``
## which decodes to the hex below). We follow the libdrm precedent
## and drift to the version nixpkgs ships so the cross-check stays
## meaningful — 1.25.0 is the current modern-desktop baseline and the
## upstream gitlab releases page confirms it as the latest stable.
##
## sha256 = c065f040afdff3177680600f249727e41a1afc22fccf27222f15f5306faa1f03
##  (computed locally over the vendored
##  ``wayland-1.25.0.tar.xz``, 609,628 bytes; matches the
##  ``sha256-wGXwQK/f8xd2gGAPJJcn5Boa/CL8zyciLxX1MG+qHwM=`` SRI hash
##  that nixpkgs ships at
##  ``pkgs/development/libraries/wayland/default.nix`` — the
##  cross-check confirms the upstream tarball is byte-identical to
##  what the broader ecosystem builds against).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_meson convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``mesonOptions:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``meson setup`` configure BuildAction that depends on the
##      fetch action and passes every flag in ``mesonOptions:`` to
##      ``meson setup``, in declared order.
##   3. a ``ninja`` compile BuildAction (M9.L).
##   4. install/output collection actions for the three library
##      artifacts + the wayland-scanner executable (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ninja-spawn + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records all four artifacts via the ``library`` / ``executable``
## blocks so the M9.K artifact registry already knows which shared
## objects / binaries to expect.
##
## ## Library vs executable artifacts
##
## Unlike dbus-broker (executables only) or libdrm (libraries only),
## Wayland's meson build emits BOTH kinds off the same configure /
## compile step:
##
##   * ``libwayland-client.so`` — the client-side protocol library,
##     linked by every Wayland app (GTK/Qt/Firefox/...).
##   * ``libwayland-server.so`` — the server-side protocol library,
##     linked by every Wayland compositor (Sway/Mutter/KWin/...).
##   * ``libwayland-cursor.so`` — cursor-theme loader used by Wayland
##     clients to render system cursors with the right theme.
##   * ``wayland-scanner``      — the protocol-code generator binary
##     that compositors + clients invoke at build time to turn
##     protocol XML into C marshalling stubs.
##
## ``libwayland-egl.so`` is technically also part of the upstream
## build but is intentionally NOT registered here — it's a thin shim
## that Mesa replaces with its own libwayland-egl at runtime via the
## ``wayland-egl-backend`` extension, so registering it would create
## an artifact-registry collision with the Mesa graphics-stack
## recipe down the line.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the meson options are hardcoded to a
## modern-desktop baseline (libraries + scanner on; documentation,
## DTD validation, and tests off to keep the build hermetic + fast).
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. a developer variant that
## flips tests on, or a packaging variant that emits documentation).

package waylandSource:
  ## From-source Wayland — third M9.H/I/K production recipe.
  ##
  ## Tier-2b c_cpp_meson convention consumer: the convention layer
  ## reads the ``fetch:`` block (registered via ``registeredFetchSpec``)
  ## and the ``mesonOptions:`` block (registered via
  ## ``registeredBuildFlags`` on the ``"meson"`` channel) and lowers
  ## them into fetch + configure BuildActions wired with the right
  ## URL + hash + flags. FIRST recipe to mix ``library`` + ``executable``
  ## artifacts in a single from-source production package.

  versions:
    ## Pinned upstream tag. ``sourceUrl`` records the canonical
    ## freedesktop.org gitlab release tarball URL so a future
    ## maintainer running ``repro update-source`` can re-fetch from
    ## upstream; the live ``fetch:`` block below points at the
    ## vendored copy for deterministic offline test reproduction.
    ##
    ## ``sourceRepository`` points at the upstream gitlab project ---
    ## Wayland's canonical home.
