## Smoke test for the from-source ``waylandSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the THIRD real production
## from-source recipe (the first was ``dbusBrokerSource``, the second
## ``libdrmSource``). Where dbus-broker exercised executable artifacts
## only and libdrm exercised library artifacts only, this one
## exercises BOTH kinds off the same package — the M3 artifact registry
## must keep ``dakLibrary`` and ``dakExecutable`` discriminators
## correctly distinguished within a single package's artifact set.
##
## Coverage:
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``mesonOptions:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (the ``cmake`` channel must NOT see the meson flags).
##   * MIXED artifact registration (M3) — three libraries
##     (``dakLibrary``) plus one executable (``dakExecutable``), all
##     attributed to ``waylandSource``, kind discriminators preserved
##     per-artifact (the unique-coverage aspect of this third recipe).
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
