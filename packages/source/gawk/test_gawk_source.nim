## Smoke test for the from-source ``gawkSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the SEVENTY-FOURTH real
## production from-source recipe. GNU awk (gawk) is THE canonical
## AWK implementation on every modern Linux distribution — every
## shell pipeline + every Makefile field-extract rule + every log-
## analysis script + every report-generation pipeline shells out to
## ``/usr/bin/awk``.
##
## Coverage (>=8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the three-flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + cmake + make channels MUST be empty).
##   * SINGLE executable artifact registration (M3) — ``awk`` tagged
##     ``dakExecutable``. The upstream binary is named ``gawk`` and
##     symlinked to ``awk`` on install; v1 pins the canonical short
##     name ``awk`` per the task brief.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
