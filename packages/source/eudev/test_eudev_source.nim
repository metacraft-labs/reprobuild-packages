## Smoke test for the from-source ``eudevSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the THIRTY-FIFTH real
## production from-source recipe. eudev's unique coverage angle vs the
## prior thirty-four is being the FIRST recipe in the corpus to ship
## an artifact identifier (``libUdev``) that COLLIDES with a sibling
## recipe's artifact identifier (systemd's ``libUdev``). The two
## recipes vendor DIFFERENT upstream implementations of the same ABI
## and the convention layer's artifact registry must track
## (packageName, artifactName) tuples — a regression that flattened
## the tuple to ``artifactName`` alone would surface here in the
## collision-distinct assertion below.
##
## Coverage (≥8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + cmake + make channels MUST be empty).
##   * THREE artifact registration (M3) — ``udevd`` + ``udevadm``
##     tagged ``dakExecutable`` + ``libUdev`` tagged ``dakLibrary``.
##   * Artifact-name collision distinctness — eudev's ``libUdev``
##     is registered under the ``eudevSource`` packageName and is
##     DISTINCT from any sibling's ``libUdev`` (the package-name
##     pin guards the collision-distinctness property).
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
