## Source-from-tarball xz recipe — the SIXTY-THIRD real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio. xz is THE canonical
## modern LZMA2 compressor / decompressor on Linux — every
## ``.tar.xz`` release tarball on ftp.gnu.org / kernel.org / freedesktop
## reaches for ``xz`` (the binary) and ``liblzma`` (the library) for
## extraction, and every recipe in this corpus that vendors a
## ``.tar.xz`` source archive (kernel + glib2 + util-linux + gettext
## + gnutls + qt6-base + ...) consumes ``xz``'s output transparently
## via the c_cpp_* fetch action's ``tar -xf`` invocation, which probes
## libmagic / file-extension and shells out to ``xzdec`` / ``xz`` for
## the lzma path.
##
## ## Why xz matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## xz / liblzma sit at the foundation of every modern source-tarball
## extraction + every package format that uses lzma compression as its
## payload codec:
##
##   * Every recipe in ``recipes/packages/source/`` that vendors a
##     ``.tar.xz`` upstream archive depends transitively on ``xz``'s
##     decompression path. The convention layer's M9.K fetch action
##     shells out to ``tar -xf`` which auto-detects lzma framing and
##     spawns ``xz --decompress`` for the payload.
##   * RPM packages (Fedora / openSUSE / RHEL family) historically used
##     lzma payload compression; modern RPMs use zstd but the lzma path
##     is still supported by ``rpm2cpio`` for legacy archives.
##   * Arch's pacman package format (``.pkg.tar.xz``) uses lzma payload
##     compression; the ``pacman`` resolver shells out to ``xz``.
##   * Debian's ``.deb`` packages can use lzma payload compression
##     (``XZ-compressed``); ``dpkg`` shells out to ``xz`` for the
##     ``data.tar.xz`` member.
##   * The kernel's ``CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ`` + ``CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE`` paths
##     decompress lzma-encoded payloads using the in-tree xz_dec/
##     unpacker which mirrors the userspace liblzma's API surface.
##   * GNOME's flatpak ``ostree`` repos use lzma compression for the
##     content-addressed blob store; libostree links against liblzma.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 5.6.3 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/xz/vendor/xz-5.6.3.tar.xz`` and reference
## it via a ``file://`` URL. The tukaani.org release URL is recorded as
## ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for documentation and
## future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:`` block points at the
## vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted fetch action is
## offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 5.6.3 (current upstream stable, post-CVE-2024-3094)
##
## xz releases are cut on tukaani.org under tags of the form ``v<X>.<Y>.<Z>``.
## 5.6.3 is the current stable as of mid-2026 — the 5.6.0 / 5.6.1
## releases shipped the CVE-2024-3094 malicious backdoor, 5.6.2 was the
## first clean post-incident release, and 5.6.3 ships the upstream's
## subsequent build-determinism fixes + the rewritten ``build-to-host.m4``
## sysmacro. The 5.6.x line carries the ABI-stable liblzma 5.x SONAME
## the v1 desktop's tarball-extraction consumers depend on; anything
## ``>=5.4`` covers the post-incident shape.
##
## sha256 = db0590629b6f0fa36e74aea5f9731dc6f8df068ce7b7bafa45301832a5eebc3a
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``xz-5.6.3.tar.xz``,
##  1,503,860 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded
##  in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into fetch + ``./configure`` + ``make``
## BuildActions; the per-artifact build body + install glue lands in
## M9.L; the recipe records the executable + library artifacts via the
## ``executable`` + ``library`` blocks so the M9.K artifact registry
## already knows what binary + shared object to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## xz's autotools build emits two load-bearing outputs from a single
## ``./configure`` + ``make`` invocation:
##
##   * ``xz``        — ``/usr/bin/xz``, the canonical compressor /
##                      decompressor CLI consumed by ``tar -xf`` for
##                      ``.tar.xz`` payloads + every distro packager.
##   * ``libLzma``   — ``libLzma.so`` (PascalCased from the upstream
##                      SONAME ``lzma``), the C library that linked
##                      consumers (rpm / dpkg / pacman / kernel
##                      module-load / ostree) reach for instead of
##                      shelling out to the binary.
##
## NOTE: xz also installs ``xzdec`` (decode-only variant) + ``lzmainfo``
## + ``unxz`` symlinks + the ``xzdiff`` / ``xzgrep`` shell wrappers
## under ``/usr/bin/``; v1 only records the canonical compressor binary
## + the load-bearing library. Downstream recipes that need ``xzdec``
## for a lighter decoder-only profile would lift the artifact
## registration in a follow-up batch.
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--disable-static`` — skip the static archive (not used by the
##                              v1 desktop story; the liblzma consumers
##                              link dynamically).
##   * ``--disable-doc``    — skip the texinfo / pdf manual build
##                              (heavy build-time cost, not needed at
##                              runtime).
##   * ``--disable-rpath``  — skip the libtool RPATH embedding (the v1
##                              desktop's dynamic linker resolves via
##                              standard /lib + /usr/lib search paths,
##                              not via embedded RPATH).
