## Source-from-tarball kwin recipe — the TWENTIETH real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio and the SECOND
## recipe in the Plasma stack batch (kcoreaddons / kwin /
## plasma-workspace / sddm).
##
## Prior nineteen from-source recipes — fourteen meson (dbus-broker,
## libdrm, wayland, wlroots, sway, libxkbcommon, pixman, libinput,
## cairo, pango, gdk-pixbuf, glib2, mutter, gnome-shell), one make
## (linux-kernel), two CMake (json-c, kcoreaddons), two autotools
## (expat, gdm) — collectively covered every M9.I flag-injection
## channel and every artifact-kind permutation. kwin is the THIRD
## CMake-driven recipe and the FIRST KWin compositor in the recipe
## suite. The unique coverage angle for this recipe is that it's the
## FIRST CMake recipe to ship BOTH a library AND an executable from
## the same ``package`` macro (json-c shipped a library, kcoreaddons
## shipped a library; this is the first CMake mixed-kind recipe). The
## mutter/gnome-shell precedents are meson; this is the CMake-side
## analogue, exercising the M3 artifact registry's mixed-kind
## partitioning from the opposite build-system channel.
##
## ## Why kwin matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## kwin is the KDE Plasma Wayland compositor — the analogue of mutter
## for the GNOME story. The standalone ``kwin_wayland`` binary is the
## display-server process the user-session leader spawns to host
## Wayland clients (the Plasma shell, all native + XWayland-bridged X11
## clients). ``libkwin.so`` is the compositor library plasma-workspace
## (NDE-K1's session leader) links against to register window-
## management hooks + effect plugins. NDE-K1's manifest layer pins the
## apt-jammy kwin .deb for v1 stubs; this from-source recipe lifts that
## pin to a real ``kwin_wayland`` binary + ``libkwin.so`` library
## artifact for the v2 Plasma story.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 6.2.5 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/kwin/vendor/kwin-6.2.5.tar.xz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The download.kde.org release URL
## is recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 6.2.5 (current upstream stable in the 6.2.x line)
##
## download.kde.org publishes KDE Plasma releases at
## ``https://download.kde.org/stable/plasma/<x.y.z>/`` and 6.2.5 is the
## current stable in the 6.2.x line as of mid-2026. The Plasma 6.2.x
## series consumes the KF6 6.x frameworks ABI line that ``kcoreaddons``
## 6.10.0 sits in, so the four Plasma-batch recipes stay in lockstep.
##
## sha256 = 5cc450a6e41105c8c49929b72550b331237f96aafb294690f4707bdc5f776848
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``kwin-6.2.5.tar.xz``, 8,563,352
##  bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded in
##  ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_cmake convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H ``fetch:``
## block and the M9.I ``cmakeFlags:`` block off this package's
## registries and lowers them into:
##
##   1. a fetch BuildAction whose argv carries the URL + sha256 +
##      extract dest (content-addressed so a re-run hits the cache).
##   2. a ``cmake`` configure BuildAction that depends on the fetch
##      action and passes every flag in ``cmakeFlags:`` to
##      ``cmake -S <src> -B <build>``, in declared order.
##   3. a ``ninja`` (or ``cmake --build``) compile BuildAction (M9.L).
##   4. install/output collection actions for the library + executable
##      artifacts (M9.L).
##
## M9.K only wires (1) + the flag-injection portion of (2). The
## downstream ninja-spawn + install glue lands in M9.L; the recipe
## records the artifacts via one ``library`` block + one
## ``executable`` block so the M9.K artifact registry already knows
## what shared object + binary to expect.
##
## ## Artifacts
##
## kwin's CMake build emits one shared library + one standalone binary:
##
##   * ``libkwin.so`` — the compositor library plasma-workspace links
##                       against to register window-management hooks +
##                       effect plugins (third-party kwin effects also
##                       link against this for their UI plugin
##                       contracts).
##   * ``kwin_wayland`` — the standalone Wayland compositor binary that
##                         hosts the Wayland display server + spawns
##                         the user session. NDE-K1's
##                         ``plasma.desktop`` Wayland session entry
##                         ``Exec``s ``startplasma-wayland`` which
##                         chain-execs into ``kwin_wayland`` for the
##                         Wayland-side, but the binary itself is
##                         exposed as ``kwin_wayland``.
##
## We register the library under the package-level identifier
## ``libKWin`` (camelCased from the upstream SONAME ``kwin`` per the
## json-c precedent — preserving the leading lib + the uppercase
## ``KWin`` brand-casing, the same shape as ``libKF6CoreAddons``), and
## the executable under ``kwinWayland`` (camelCased from the upstream
## binary name ``kwin_wayland`` per the same convention).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the CMake options are hardcoded to the
## modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``BUILD_TESTING=OFF``     — skip the upstream test suite to keep
##                                  the build hermetic + fast.
##   * ``KWIN_BUILD_TABBOX=OFF`` — skip the legacy task-switcher tab-box
##                                  UI (modern Plasma uses the
##                                  KWin-scripted task switcher
##                                  instead).
##   * ``KWIN_BUILD_X11=OFF``    — skip the X11/XWayland session
##                                  support (the v1 Plasma story is
##                                  pure-Wayland; the NDE-K1 spec
##                                  pins only ``plasma.desktop``,
##                                  not ``plasmax11.desktop``).
##   * ``KWIN_BUILD_KCMS=OFF``   — skip the System Settings ``kcm``
##                                  modules (the v1 minimal Plasma
##                                  variant ships no Settings GUI;
##                                  user-config is driven by NDE-K1's
##                                  ``configFile`` emissions
##                                  directly).
##   * ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`` — release-mode optimisation;
##                                  matches the sibling from-source
##                                  recipes' ``--buildtype=release``
##                                  meson option.
##
## Downstream configuration knobs would live here when the per-distro
## variants need different strategies (e.g. an X11-supporting variant
## that flips ``KWIN_BUILD_X11=ON`` for legacy bundles).
