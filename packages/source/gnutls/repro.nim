## Source-from-tarball gnutls recipe — the FIFTY-FOURTH real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio. gnutls is the GNU
## TLS / DTLS library — the non-openssl half of the modern Linux TLS
## stack. Closes the crypto-and-FFI batch (libffi + nettle + libgcrypt +
## gnutls) and provides the GNU TLS / DTLS implementation that consumers
## like glib-networking (when the gnutls backend is selected),
## gstreamer's TLS transport, and the gnome-online-accounts SOUP TLS
## layer reach for instead of openssl.
##
## ## Why gnutls matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## gnutls is the GNU TLS / DTLS library at the bottom of the GNOME
## networking stack's non-openssl backend selection:
##
##   * glib-networking ships TWO TLS backends — openssl-based and
##     gnutls-based — selected at build time. Distros that ship the
##     gnutls backend (Fedora historically, Debian via the
##     ``glib-networking-services-gnutls`` virtual) route every GIO
##     TLS stream through libgnutls.
##   * GStreamer's ``souphttpsrc`` element + ``tlsenc`` / ``tlsdec``
##     base elements link against gnutls for the encrypted-pipeline
##     transport layer.
##   * GNOME Online Accounts (``goa-daemon``) uses libsoup's TLS layer
##     (which in turn defers to whichever glib-networking backend is
##     installed) for OAuth2 token-exchange flows.
##   * The gnutls-cli + gnutls-serv binaries (we ``--disable-tools`` so
##     these are NOT installed) are the canonical TLS-debug CLIs used
##     by sysadmins to test certificate chains.
##
## Sibling consumers pinning ``libgnutls >=3.7`` include
## glib-networking (when its gnutls backend is selected at build time)
## and gstreamer.
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 3.8.8 .tar.xz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/gnutls/vendor/gnutls-3.8.8.tar.xz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The gnupg.org release URL is
## recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 3.8.8 (current upstream stable)
##
## gnutls releases are cut on gnupg.org under tags of the form
## ``gnutls_<X>_<Y>_<Z>``. 3.8.8 is the current stable in the 3.8.x
## line as of mid-2026 and the ABI is stable since the 3.6 cut —
## anything ``>=3.7`` covers the glib-networking + gstreamer
## consumption.
##
## sha256 = ac4f020e583880b51380ed226e59033244bc536cad2623f2e26f5afa2939d8fb
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``gnutls-3.8.8.tar.xz``,
##  6,696,460 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded
##  in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H
## ``fetch:`` block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this
## package's registries and lowers them into fetch + ``./configure`` +
## ``make`` BuildActions; the per-artifact build body + install glue
## lands in M9.L; the recipe records the single library artifact via
## the ``library`` block so the M9.K artifact registry already knows
## what shared object to expect.
##
## ## Library artifact
##
## gnutls's autotools build emits a single shared library
## (``libgnutls.so``) bundling the TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3 record layer +
## handshake state machine + certificate-validation pipeline + DTLS
## datagram support + SRP / PSK / anonymous KEX layers. We register
## the artifact under the package-level identifier ``libGnutls``
## (PascalCased from the upstream SONAME ``gnutls`` per the libCrypto /
## libExpat / libGlib2 precedent of preserving the canonical ``lib``
## prefix while PascalCasing the SONAME body).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief. This flag set pins
## the per-channel handling of a larger-cardinality flag sequence
## against a regression that truncated mid-sequence:
##
##   * ``--disable-static``   — skip the static archive (not used by
##                               the v1 desktop story; libs are
##                               dynamic).
##   * ``--disable-doc``      — skip the texinfo / pdf manual build.
##   * ``--without-p11-kit``  — skip the PKCS#11 token-discovery layer
##                               (heavy NSS dependency surface; the v1
##                               desktop story uses GnuTLS's built-in
##                               cert store, not the p11-kit dispatcher).
##   * ``--disable-tools``    — skip the gnutls-cli + gnutls-serv
##                               + certtool binaries (heavy dependency
##                               surface; sysadmins debug TLS via
##                               openssl s_client today).
##   * ``--disable-cxx``      — skip the C++ ABI wrapper layer (no v1
##                               desktop consumer reaches for it).
##   * ``--disable-tests``    — skip the upstream test suite (heaviest
##                               portion of the build; not needed at
##                               runtime). Matches the openssl
##                               ``no-tests`` + the expat
##                               ``--without-tests`` precedent.
##   * ``--with-included-libtasn1`` — build the ASN.1 parser from the
##                               source bundled in the release tarball.
##   * ``--with-included-unistring`` — build Unicode helpers from the
##                               bundled source instead of requiring a
##                               separate host library.
##   * ``--without-idn``    — leave IDNA hostname conversion to callers,
##                               avoiding an undeclared libidn2 runtime
##                               edge.
