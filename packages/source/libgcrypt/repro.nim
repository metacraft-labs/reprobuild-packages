## Source-from-tarball libgcrypt recipe — the FIFTY-THIRD real
## from-source production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio.
## libgcrypt is the GnuPG project's higher-level cryptography library —
## the wrapper that GnuPG (gpg, gpg-agent, gpgsm), gnutls, and the
## libsecret keychain layer reach for to do "give me an AES context"
## or "verify this RSA signature" without dropping down to nettle's
## primitive ABI. FIRST recipe in the corpus to vendor a .tar.bz2
## archive (the prior fifty-two used .tar.gz or .tar.xz).
##
## ## Why libgcrypt matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## libgcrypt is the GnuPG project's higher-level cryptography library
## consumed by basically every GnuPG-adjacent surface on the modern
## Linux desktop:
##
##   * GnuPG (``gpg``, ``gpg-agent``, ``gpgsm``) uses libgcrypt for every
##     symmetric + asymmetric + hash operation in OpenPGP and S/MIME.
##   * libsecret / GNOME Keyring uses libgcrypt for the keyring's
##     symmetric encryption + key-derivation function.
##   * KMail / KGpg uses libgcrypt transitively through GnuPG for
##     S/MIME signing + verification.
##   * dnsmasq's DNSSEC validation links libgcrypt for the RSA / ECDSA
##     verify path.
##   * libdns / nss-tls / glib-networking pass through libgcrypt when
##     their gnutls backend is selected.
##
## Sibling consumers pinning ``libgcrypt >=1.10`` include the gnutls
## recipe (alternative backend selection at configure time) and the
## libsecret recipe (when it lands; v1 desktop story has it on the
## roadmap).
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 1.11.0 .tar.bz2 at
## ``recipes/packages/source/libgcrypt/vendor/libgcrypt-1.11.0.tar.bz2``
## and reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The gnupg.org release URL is
## recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 1.11.0 (current upstream stable)
##
## libgcrypt releases are cut on gnupg.org under tags of the form
## ``libgcrypt-<X>.<Y>.<Z>``. 1.11.0 is the current stable in the 1.x
## line as of mid-2026 and the ABI is stable since the 1.10 cut —
## anything ``>=1.10`` covers the GnuPG + libsecret + gnutls (when
## --with-libgcrypt is selected) consumption.
##
## sha256 = 09120c9867ce7f2081d6aaa1775386b98c2f2f246135761aae47d81f58685b9c
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``libgcrypt-1.11.0.tar.bz2``,
##  4,180,345 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded
##  in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H
## ``fetch:`` block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this
## package's registries and lowers them into fetch + ``./configure`` +
## ``make`` BuildActions; the per-artifact build body + install glue
## lands in M9.L; the recipe records the single library artifact via
## the ``library`` block so the M9.K artifact registry already knows
## what shared object to expect.
##
## ## Library artifact
##
## libgcrypt's autotools build emits a single shared library
## (``libgcrypt.so``) bundling the higher-level cipher + MAC + KDF +
## entropy + asymmetric API on top of the libgpg-error helper library.
## We register the artifact under the package-level identifier
## ``libGcrypt`` (PascalCased from the upstream SONAME ``gcrypt`` per
## the libCrypto / libExpat / libGlib2 precedent of preserving the
## canonical ``lib`` prefix while PascalCasing the SONAME body).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--disable-static``          — skip the static archive (not
##                                      used by the v1 desktop story;
##                                      libs are dynamic).
##   * ``--disable-doc``             — skip the texinfo / pdf manual
##                                      build (heavy texinfo dependency
##                                      surface, not needed at runtime).
##   * ``--disable-padlock-support`` — disable the VIA PadLock AES
##                                      hardware acceleration code
##                                      path (modern x86_64 CPUs ship
##                                      AES-NI instead; PadLock support
##                                      is dead-code on every supported
##                                      v1 desktop host and trips
##                                      reproducibility on CPUs that
##                                      claim PadLock but mis-implement
##                                      it).
