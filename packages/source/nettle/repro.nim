## Source-from-tarball nettle recipe — the FIFTY-SECOND real from-source
## production recipe to exercise the M9.H/I/K trio. nettle is the
## low-level cryptography library at the bottom of the GnuTLS stack and
## the primary crypto-primitives library for the GNU project's
## non-OpenSSL surface (GnuPG's libgcrypt is the higher-level wrapper).
## Pairs with the sibling ``libgcrypt`` (recipe 53) + ``gnutls``
## (recipe 54) to build out the GNU TLS / crypto stack independently of
## openssl.
##
## ## Why nettle matters for the v1 desktop story
##
## nettle is the low-level cryptography library at the bottom of the
## GnuTLS stack and the GNU project's non-OpenSSL crypto surface:
##
##   * ``libnettle.so``  — the symmetric-cipher + hash + AEAD primitive
##                          library (AES, ChaCha20, SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2,
##                          Poly1305). Consumed by GnuTLS's record-layer
##                          encryption, GnuPG's symmetric encryption
##                          fallback, the Linux IMA verification layer's
##                          alternative-backend hash path, and Ratbox-
##                          style IRC daemons.
##   * ``libhogweed.so`` — the public-key cipher library (RSA, DSA,
##                          ECDSA, EdDSA, X25519 ECDH) layered on top
##                          of libnettle. Consumed by GnuTLS's
##                          certificate-validation path + GnuPG's
##                          public-key cipher fallback. (The name
##                          ``hogweed`` is the upstream pun on libnettle:
##                          common hogweed is a plant of the same family
##                          as stinging nettle. Pre-2019 the public-key
##                          bits were inside libnettle; the 3.x cut
##                          split them out.)
##
## Sibling consumers pinning ``libnettle >=3.7`` / ``libhogweed >=6.0``
## include the gnutls recipe (TLS handshake's cipher + KEX layers) and
## the libgcrypt recipe (transitively, since GnuPG can be configured to
## use nettle as a fallback backend).
##
## ## sha256 strategy
##
## We vendor the upstream 3.10 .tar.gz at
## ``recipes/packages/source/nettle/vendor/nettle-3.10.tar.gz`` and
## reference it via a ``file://`` URL. The ftp.gnu.org release URL is
## recorded as ``sourceUrl`` in the ``versions:`` block for
## documentation and future-bump purposes, but the live ``fetch:``
## block points at the vendored copy so the convention layer's emitted
## fetch action is offline-reproducible.
##
## ## Version choice — 3.10 (current upstream stable)
##
## nettle releases are cut on ftp.gnu.org under tags of the form
## ``nettle_<X>_<Y>``. 3.10 is the current stable in the 3.x line as of
## mid-2026 and the ABI is stable since the 3.7 cut — anything ``>=3.7``
## covers the GnuTLS + GnuPG consumption.
##
## sha256 = b4c518adb174e484cb4acea54118f02380c7133771e7e9beb98a0787194ee47c
##  (computed locally over the vendored ``nettle-3.10.tar.gz``,
##  2,640,485 bytes; downloaded once from the upstream URL recorded
##  in ``versions:`` above).
##
## ## Build shape
##
## The c_cpp_autotools convention (M9.K) reads both the M9.H
## ``fetch:`` block and the M9.I ``configureFlags:`` block off this
## package's registries and lowers them into fetch + ``./configure`` +
## ``make`` BuildActions; the per-artifact build body + install glue
## lands in M9.L; the recipe records the two library artifacts via the
## ``library`` blocks so the M9.K artifact registry already knows what
## shared objects to expect.
##
## ## Library artifacts
##
## nettle's autotools build emits TWO load-bearing shared libraries
## from a single ``./configure`` + ``make`` invocation:
##
##   * ``libnettle.so``  — the symmetric-cipher + hash + AEAD primitive
##                          library (AES, ChaCha20, SHA-2, SHA-3,
##                          BLAKE2, Poly1305).
##   * ``libhogweed.so`` — the public-key cipher library (RSA, DSA,
##                          ECDSA, EdDSA, X25519 ECDH) layered on top
##                          of libnettle.
##
## We register the artifacts under the package-level identifiers
## ``libNettle`` and ``libHogweed`` (PascalCased from the upstream
## SONAMEs ``nettle`` and ``hogweed`` per the libCrypto / libSsl
## precedent of preserving the canonical ``lib`` prefix while
## PascalCasing the SONAME body).
##
## ## Configurables
##
## v1 ships NO configurables — the configure flags are hardcoded to
## the modern-desktop baseline per the task brief:
##
##   * ``--disable-static``        — skip the static archive (not used
##                                    by the v1 desktop story; libs are
##                                    dynamic).
##   * ``--disable-documentation`` — skip the texinfo / pdf manual
##                                    build (heavy texinfo dependency
##                                    surface, not needed at runtime).
##   * ``--enable-shared``         — explicitly build the shared
##                                    library variant; nettle's
##                                    autotools build defaults to
##                                    shared on Linux but the explicit
##                                    flag pins the convention against
##                                    a future static-only host probe.
