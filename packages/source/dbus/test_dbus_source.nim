## Smoke test for the from-source ``dbusSource`` recipe.
##
## Pins the M9.H/I/K trio's behaviour on the FORTIETH real production
## from-source recipe. Upstream dbus 1.16.0 ships meson-only (the
## autotools layer was retired before the cut); the recipe and this
## test were converted from autotools-shape to meson-shape in
## ``M9.R.15a.1``. One executable (``dbusDaemon``) + one library
## (``libDbus1``) from a single ``meson setup`` + ``ninja`` invocation
## — exercising the executable + library mixed-kind shape on the
## meson channel.
##
## Coverage (≥8 tests with multiple assertions each):
##
##   * ``fetch:`` block round-trip (M9.H) — URL + sha256 length +
##     algorithm + kind discriminant + extractStrip.
##   * ``configureFlags:`` block round-trip (M9.I) — exact-order
##     sequence equality on the production flag set + channel-isolation
##     spot-check (meson + cmake channels MUST be empty).
##   * TWO artifact registration (M3) — ``dbusDaemon`` tagged
##     ``dakExecutable`` + ``libDbus1`` tagged ``dakLibrary``.
##   * ``versions:`` block round-trip (M2) — upstream tag + URL +
##     repository for ``repro update-source``.
